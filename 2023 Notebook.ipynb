As you heard, over the next hour, Randy Powers and I will cover key highlights of our executive compensation program, and briefly touch on the four shareholder proposals that are in the proxy. We realize that this is a very busy time of year for you, so we would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to participate in this meeting this morning.\", \"As in prior years, the webcast is part of our broad shareholder outreach effort.

And in this regard, please feel free to submit your questions via the Internet at any time during the session. The next slide is our cautionary statement. And I'll note, the compensation-related terms and footnotes are included at the end of this presentation for your reference.\", 'Briefly moving to shareholder engagement on slide 4, we believe ongoing engagement with our shareholders is vitally important, and keeping our shareholders informed on relevant business matters is very much a priority for the company. Company connects with shareholders through a variety of venues. We engage directly throughout the year to address matters of interest and we strive to respond to all shareholder inquiries.', 'Now, of course, the Annual Shareholders Meeting is a time when we interface with many individual and institutional shareholders. Our corporate website, company publications and webcasts such as this one are other ways that we communicate with you and provide important information about our company.', \"I'll also note the board also has long established procedures for shareholder communications directly with individual directors, including the presiding director, our board committee members, or the non-employee directors as a group. More information about the process for communicating directly with our board members may be found in the proxy statement. Our key message here is that we welcome and we value input from all shareholders, and this input is taken seriously by the company and it's considered in the company's deliberations.\", \"I'll now turn it over to Randy who'll review our executive compensation program.\"]}}, {'@id': '2', 'plist': {'p': [\"Thank you, Jeff. I'd like to start today's overview by reflecting on the strategic design priorities in our executive compensation program. These priorities underpin our goal of achieving sustainable growth and shareholder value. Specifically, our compensation program is designed to link executive pay to business performance and tie executive pay to the experience of long-term shareholders. I will review how these two design priorities work, how our shareholder engagement process continues to result in improvements in our program and disclosure, how we paid our CEO in 2017, and I'll finish up with a short review of our governance practices.\", \"Before I move into the details of our compensation program, I'd like to share with you an important feature that I will emphasize throughout the discussion this morning. Specifically, ExxonMobil's incentive program incorporates performance criteria at grant versus vest, which creates a strong linkage between performance and pay, while at the same time allowing for longer restriction periods versus alternative designs.\", 'By applying the performance criteria at grant, we eliminate the constraint inherent in alternative programs that involve short-term target setting. The constraint is that performance and restriction periods in these alternative programs must be shorter, three years or less, in order to maintain line of sight to develop credible and achievable targets. These shorter performance and restriction periods do not align with the ExxonMobil business model.', \"Conversely, applying the performance criteria to the determination of the number of shares at grant eliminates the short-term line of sight constraint and it allows for longer restriction periods and, therefore, true alignment with the experience of our long-term shareholders. Given the significant performance hurdles designed into our program at grant, which I'll describe in greater detail in a few slides, combined with restriction periods that are three times longer than most comparative companies, the ExxonMobil program has a very strong pay-for-performance basis.\", 'Let me turn to the next slide. This slide contains three key messages. First, our compensation program links executive pay to company performance. As the first bullet point indicates, in 2017 the performance share awards for our CEO and other NEOs were reduced. This is because our 10-year Total Shareholder Return was not leading average of industry peers, even though we lag in all other performance metrics. This decision is also consistent with the commitment the Committee made to shareholders over the years. The process followed by the Committee to make this decision will be explained in more detail in a moment.', 'At the same time, company earnings increased in 2017, which resulted in a higher annual bonus versus 2016. Also, as the fourth bullet point indicates, over the last 10-year period, the sum of realized plus all unrealized compensation for our CEO position is at the 44th percentile of the compensation benchmark company CEOs.', 'Now, as indicated by the second circle on this chart, executive pay is tied to long-term shareholder experience. Because the majority of senior executive pay is delivered in performance shares with long restriction periods, CEO compensation is ultimately tied closely to share price at vest, which achieves alignment with the experience of long-term shareholders. That is, the program puts executives in the shoes of the long-term shareholders.', \"Regarding the third circle, I'd like to reiterate a point that Jeff made earlier. Shareholder engagement is very important to us, including the feedback we receive through our engagement process, as well as this webcast. This year, we've made a number of changes to our program and disclosure based on that feedback, which I will outline as we go through this presentation.\", \"As indicated on the chart, the main items of shareholder feedback to which we responded in our disclosure and with our program were as follows. First, a request for more granularity regarding the time period over which business performance is measured, which we have delineated at 10 years in this year's disclosure. Second, a suggestion that we decoupled the performance metrics of the short-term bonus program from the long-term performance share program, which the Committee did in 2017.\", 'And third, a request for more clarity on how the Compensation Committee determines the size of annual share grants. A detailed flowchart was included in the disclosure this year in the Executive Compensation Overview on page 2 and in the proxy on page 30 for this purpose. And fourth, a suggestion that we provide more specificity regarding our relative company performance against peers. This information is disclosed on page 1 of the Executive Compensation Overview, as well as pages 6 and 7 of the Executive Compensation Overview and pages 29, 34 and 35 of the proxy.', 'Let me turn to the next slide at this time. Performance against five pre-established metrics over investment lead times of the business forms the basis for determining awards in the performance share program. As indicated on this slide, the confirmation in our disclosure – and as discussed on the prior slide, the confirmation on our disclosure of 10 years is the time period the Compensation Committee uses to assess performance, as well as more granular disclosure of relative company performance and key metrics are the direct result of shareholder feedback.', 'Looking now at how we performed; performance is measured against companies within the oil and gas industry of similar scale and complexity. An industry leadership over the preceding 10-year period is required to achieve a maximum performance share award. 10 years approximates the investment lead times of our business. We continue to lead on workforce safety performance for both our employees and contractors.', 'Regarding return on average capital employed, ExxonMobil has a balanced and highly competitive portfolio of resources, assets and products, resulting in industry-leading return on capital over the business cycle. As mentioned, our 10-year TSR was not leading the average of industry peers and on this basis, 2017 performance share awards were reduced for the CEO and named executive officers.', 'Now, you will also note that the Compensation Committee replaced the free cash flow metric with cash flow from operations and asset sales, which not only encourages cash generation, but is neutral to the uses of cash. While we still lead industry peers in both metrics, cash flow from operations and asset sales is a better metric for driving the right executive behaviors.', 'Also, in the past, we have used shareholder distributions yield as a metric. While we continue to lead in this metric, it was removed this year as the TSR metric already reflects the value of dividend growth and share buybacks over time. Additionally, distribution yield metrics could inappropriately benefit from reductions in share price and vice versa.', 'We have disclosed our relative performance on these two eliminated metrics on page 44 of our proxy so that shareholders can still see our leading position on these metrics over the relevant time period of 10 years. These changes in the metrics do not in any way diminish our strong commitment to the dividend and dividend growth, which remain a very high priority for the company. And, finally, we experienced strong performance in achieving our strategic objectives and our business results and project execution were also strong.', 'Now, as shown in the last two bullets on this chart, when assessing company performance, the Compensation Committee does not allow outstanding performance in one metric to cancel out poor performance in another. And if we determine that another executive would make a stronger contribution than a current executive officer, a succession plan is implemented and the incumbent is reassigned or separated. This reinforces the performance orientation of the program. And finally on this chart, for more granular detail on relative company performance against each metric in our industry peers, please see our Executive Compensation Overview on pages 6 and 7, and the 2018 proxy on pages 34 and 35.', \"Let's go to the next slide. On this side, which is also in response to shareholder feedback, we are providing more granularity and clarity on how the Compensation Committee determines the size of annual performance share awards, which currently make up over 60% of CEO pay. Let me walk you through the sequence of the decision-making process. First, maximum award levels are set by determining the competitive orientation of total pay against our compensation benchmark companies.\", 'Second, the Compensation Committee then assesses relative company performance against the five pre-established performance metrics we discussed on the previous slide versus our peers in the industry. Then in steps three and four, the Committee grants performance shares based on that assessment of company performance and the market orientation of total compensation. So, in effect, the Committee looks to find the right balance between these two data points, whereby market orientation is key to the retention of senior executives and measuring business performance is key to maintaining alignment with shareholder priorities.', 'For example, in the case of the 2017 performance share awards, the Committee decided to put downward pressure on the future market orientation of the CEO position by reducing the number of shares at grant. As a result of TSR performance, it was not leading the average of industry peers over the 10-year period through year-end 2007 (sic) [2017] (00:16:30). This process, combined with stock price performance, has resulted in a 44th percentile market orientation for our CEO position over the last 10-year period; the period that aligns, as I indicated earlier, with the investment lead times of our business.', \"Let's go to the next slide. Finishing up our discussion of the performance share program, it is important not to underestimate the impact of long-term restriction periods on the number of performance shares that our executives are required to hold through the business and commodity price cycles. Given the long-term nature of the oil and gas business, it is crucial that executives are unable to monetize performance shares before significant downturns in the commodity cycle.\", \"With restriction periods of 5, 10 years and longer on performance shares, ExxonMobil executives will experience the full impact of the commodity price cycle similar to our long-term shareholders. I've often said that the best way to explain our compensation program is to explain the alternative and how it would work in a particular business model; in this case, the ExxonMobil business model.\", \"The example on this page appears in our Executive Compensation Overview on page 3 and then in the 2018 proxy on page 31, where it shows that an alternate formula-based program with short-term target setting and three-year vesting would allow monetization of performance shares at a much faster pace than the ExxonMobil program. For example, in 2013, on the eve of a greater-than-50% decline in crude price, only 8% of awards granted in the ExxonMobil program had vested versus an alternate program in which 58% would have vested, i.e., 7 times more than the ExxonMobil program which, in effect, would have removed a substantial portion of the commodity price risk for executives in the alternative program. The Compensation Committee simply feels or believes that that's not right, given that our long-term shareholders do not have that benefit.\", 'Due to the design feature of long restriction periods, ExxonMobil executives must hold their shares to the commodity price cycle and must take a long-term view in making business decisions. Furthermore, this helps hold executives accountable for project success many years after making initial project investment decisions.', \"Let's go to the next slide. Now, as we move to the annual bonus program, I'd like to re-emphasize that we have now decoupled performance metrics for this program from the long-term performance share program as requested by shareholders. This change to the program, is in fact – to repeat myself, is in fact in response to shareholder feedback.\", 'Our annual bonus program ties executive compensation to annual business performance. However, the size of the annual bonus pool, which is determined by a formula, is deliberately kept as a small percentage of total compensation so that we do not undermine the long-term orientation priority of the overall program. This bonus program has been applied consistently in each of the last 16 years, including years in which earnings declined.', 'To determine the bonus pool size, we multiply the percent change in annual earnings by two-thirds. The result is the percent change in the bonus pool from the previous year. Two-thirds factor is intended to help recognize the realities of the commodity price swings in any given year at either direction.', \"Because of the increase in earnings from 2016 to 2017, the overall bonus program for 2017 was increased. However, even with this program increase, this 2017 program is still nearly 50% lower than the 2012 bonus program. To determine individual bonus grants, we apply the formula shown in the slide, as well as changes in the executives' pay grade. In addition, the Compensation Committee can apply negative discretion for individual performance concerns.\", 'Half of the annual bonus is delivered at grant in cash, while the other half is delayed until cumulative earnings per share reach a certain specified level. The EPS threshold for paying out the deferred portion is $6.50 per share and that threshold was not reduced during this period of lower commodity prices. We want to be clear that this delay feature is unique to ExxonMobil and is considered secondary to the primary performance metric of annual earnings. The delay feature increases the performance orientation of the short-term bonus program, by putting half of the annual bonus at risk of forfeiture during the delay period.', \"Let's turn to the next slide. I'd like to finish this section by highlighting this chart, which illustrates the scale of ExxonMobil and each business section – business segment, excuse me, on the basis of 2017 revenue. All three business segments on a standalone basis would rank among other large companies based on revenue. The primary factor in determining compensation levels by the Compensation Committee is business and individual performance as we've discussed and is measured across the five pre-established performance metrics previously covered.\", 'However, the Committee also believes that the compensation program should recognize that our senior executives are responsible for managing a larger investment on behalf of shareholders relative to that of most other large, publicly-traded companies. And as such, the size and complexity of ExxonMobil are considered among several factors.', \"Let's turn to the next slide. Let me now focus on CEO compensation. The design objectives and features that we have been discussing translated into a 36% decline in reported pay to our CEO position from 2016 to 2017 from $27.4 million to $17.5 million respectively.\", \"Some of that difference is the result of having a new incumbent in the role, as our philosophy requires our executives to grow into their roles over time as they gain experience. However, as we discussed, there was also a decrease in the performance share award based on our relative 10-year TSR performance, which also contributed to the difference in year-over-year reported pay for our CEO position. These impacts more than offset the increase in the bonus program. As I said, the bonus program is intentionally a small proportion of overall pay. This approach is aligned with the Compensation Committee's continuing emphasis on long-term compensation to match the nature of our business model and the experience of long-term shareholders. Let's go to the next slide.\", \"Now, looking at reported pay in isolation, it's not the most complete way to assess compensation. For this reason, we've also disclosed CEO realized and unrealized pay and we've received positive feedback from our shareholders on the additional perspective it provides. In fact, on average, our CEO's realized pay is 47% of reported pay for the 2008 to 2017 period. When you compare realized pay to our compensation benchmark companies over the same period, pay for the ExxonMobil CEO position is at the 20th percentile, which ranks 10 out of the 13 companies.\", 'Finally, when you add unrealized pay to this analysis, which is the unvested portion of compensation that has been previously granted and valued at 2017 year-end stock prices of both ExxonMobil and the benchmark companies, ExxonMobil CEO pay is at the 44th percentile of benchmark companies over the time period 2008 to 2017 and that ranks 8 out of the 13 companies. We believe that this in-depth analysis provides a more balanced and accurate perspective on how ExxonMobil CEO compensation compares to that of our compensation benchmark companies.', \"Let's go to the next slide. Our program is also underpinned by sound governance practices based on a desire to discourage inappropriate risk taking. Our long restriction periods on performance shares far exceed typical three-year vesting that is common across most industries and are strongly integrated with our business model and the interests of our long-term shareholders, which is particularly important in an industry with significant exposure to volatile commodity prices as I described earlier. The very nature of these long restriction periods by design results in required stock ownership that far exceeds typical stock ownership guidelines at our compensation benchmark companies.\", 'For example, our CEO has 36 times base salary in performance shares compared to the typical six times base salary guideline among our compensation benchmark companies.', 'Shares earned in the performance share program are restricted even beyond retirement and unvested shares remain at risk of forfeiture for resignation or detrimental activity, as does the delayed portion of the annual bonus.', 'To be clear, restrictions are not accelerated due to retirement. Additionally, we do not use employment contracts, severance agreements, or changing control arrangements for the CEO and other namely executive officers, and we do not adjust annual bonus or stock grants to balance changes in the value of prior grants.', \"Let's go to the next slide. In closing, I'd like to say that on behalf of your Board of Directors, we recognize your vote is important and we encourage you to carefully consider the information provided today and vote for the advisory vote to approve executive compensation.\", 'In summary, the compensation program links executive pay to long-term company performance; second, executive pay is tied to the long-term shareholder experience through restriction periods that are 3 to 5 times out of competitors and companies in other industries; and third, shareholder feedback continues to result in program and disclosure improvements.', \"With that, Jeff, I'd like to turn it back to you.\"]}}, {'@id': '1', 'plist': {'p': [\"Thank you, Randy. Next, I'll highlight our 2018 Energy and Carbon Summary, which was included in our proxy materials. We've had, as we've talked to many of you, we've had substantial engagement with their shareholders on this important topic, both before and after release of the new report. This disclosure addresses feedback from our shareholders, including the 2017 shareholder proposal, which received majority support at last year's shareholder meeting, that being the report on impacts of climate change policies.\", 'The recent Energy and Carbon Summary includes enhancements that were, in fact, suggested by our shareholders as part of our engagements. These include things such as demand sensitivities, including impacts from electric vehicle and renewable energy penetration, potential 2-degree scenarios and what that could mean to our business, importantly, how ExxonMobil has been positioning for a low-carbon energy future and additional perspective on our pursuits in lower carbon energy technology. We would encourage you to review the webcast of an Energy and Carbon Session that was held as part of our March analyst meeting and that webcast is available for replay in the Investors section of our corporate website.', \"Now, I'd like to turn to the shareholder proposals. And once again, we do appreciate the opportunity to engage with our shareholders. Each year, the Corporation does receive a number of suggestions from shareholders, some of which are in the form of proposals to be presented at the annual meeting. I'll note that we always seek a dialogue with the proponents and co-filers. And often, we're able to reach alignment and exclude the proposal from the proxy. And this year, we reached a resolution on nearly half of the shareholder proposals received.\", 'For the remainder of the proposals, we are generally in agreement on the objectives or the principles, but we differ on the approach. Nonetheless, we are firmly committed to maintaining constructive dialogue to work toward resolution.', {'mark': {'@type': 'ph'}, '#text': 'So, as I just mentioned many times, ExxonMobil  and its (00:31:44) shareholders are able to agree on objectives, but occasionally, we cannot align on approach to reach those objectives and the shareholder proposals that I will cover on the next four slides are examples of this.'}, 'So first, regarding the Independent Chairman proposal, we agree with the importance of a strong and independent board, dedicated to representing the interests of shareholders and providing oversight of company management, including the CEO. We simply do not agree that a combined Chairman and CEO position hinders this objective. All of our directors, including the presiding director, are independent except for the CEO. Likewise, our Audit, Board Affairs, our Compensation and our Public Issues Committees are fully independent as shown in the proxy. The Board believes it should retain flexibility to select the best leadership structure that will best serve the long-term interests of its shareholders and therefore recommends against this proposal.', {'mark': {'@type': 'ph'}, '#text': \"Next on the proposal regarding Special Shareholders' Meetings, it's important to emphasize that ExxonMobil shareholders currently have the right to call Special Shareholders' Meetings. This requires at least 10% of the outstanding shares, consistent with the proposal and  a showing of (00:33:17) good cause to disclose purpose and intent to all shareholders. We do not believe that this is an onerous requirement and it demonstrates legitimate purpose to all of our shareholders. Therefore, the board recommends against this proposal.\"}, 'Turning now to the Board Diversity Matrix proposal, let me say that we fully agree that diversity of experience, background, ender, and ethnicity are critical to the composition and the competence of our board and that shareholders should know that our board benefits from the perspectives that this diversity brings. However, we do not agree that a prescribed matrix format is imperative in conveying this information. Instead, we provide detailed biographies in the proxy in our website on each individual director, as well as a summary of the collective competencies and diversity of the entire board. Let me just say diversity remains a key emphasis for the board as demonstrated by its current composition. Here again, the board recommends a vote against this proposal.', \"On the fourth and final shareholder proposal, requesting a report on lobbying, we again agree with appropriate transparency and disclosure of lobbying policy, activities and expenditures and we fully comply with both the spirit and letter of all federal and state laws on lobbying. Detailed information is available online, including key issues and the company's position thereon, as well as lobbying activities and expenditures. This includes costs incurred in trade associations lobbying. For these reasons, the board recommends against this proposal.\", \"So, this concludes our prepared remarks.

How does the Compensation Committee assess improvements as well as relative performance?\", 'Safety performances assess against a petroleum industry benchmark that is available from the API, the American Petroleum Institute. The Committee recognizes the historically strong safety performance of ExxonMobil against this benchmark and the annual results are factored into their company performance assessment.', 'In addition to the API benchmark, the Committee also includes operations integrity items as referenced in the question, including sustainability in the overall assessment of operations integrity.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.\"]}}, {'@id': '1', 'plist': {'p': [\"Good morning. And welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2013. I will refer to the slides that are available through the investors sections of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide 2.\", \"Moving to slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth remained constrained in the third quarter with mixed performance across the region. The U.S. economy continues to grow at a moderate pace following an upward revision of second quarter growth. China's growth improved modestly while Europe's economic conditions remain uncertain.\", 'Energy markets delivered mixed results compared to the second quarter, with higher crude oil and lower natural gas prices. Global industry refining margins deteriorated significantly reflecting moderate demand and improved capacity availability. Chemical commodity product margins strengthened during the quarter on lower feedstock costs and increased U.S. demand.', \"Turning now to the third quarter financial results as shown on slide 4, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $7.9 billion or $1.79 per share. The corporation distributed $5.8 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares.\", 'CapEx in the third quarter was $10.5 billion and $32.6 billion for the first nine months of 2013, in line with anticipated spending plans.', 'Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $13.6 billion. At the end of the third quarter, cash totaled $5.7 billion and debt was $21.3 billion.', 'The next slide provides additional detail on third quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased from $5 billion to $5.7 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $13.6 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment of $9.1 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.8 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased cash by $2 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the fourth quarter.', \"Moving on to slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings of $7.9 billion decreased $1.7 billion from the third quarter of 2012. Lower downstream earnings were partly offset by higher upstream and chemical earnings. In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 7, earnings increased by about $1 billion across all segments reflecting higher upstream realizations, lower refining maintenance, improved chemical commodity margins and lower corporate and financing expenses. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.\", 'Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 8.Upstream earnings in the third quarter were $6.7 billion, up $740 million from the third quarter of 2012. Stronger prices increased earnings by $440 million as worldwide crude oil and natural gas realizations increased by $2.85 per barrel and $0.56 per thousand cubic feet, respectively. Production volume and mix effects increased earnings by a net $20 million as the benefit from higher liquid volumes was mostly offset by the impact of crude underlifts and lower natural production. All other items, mainly favorable tax and foreign exchange impacts, increased earnings by $280 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the third quarter were $18.16.', 'Moving to slide 9, production increased by 58,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.5% from the third quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 83,000 barrels per day or 3.9%. Lower down time, mainly in Nigeria, the U.S, Kazakhstan, and Canada, ramp-up at the Kearl and Nigeria satellite projects and continued increased production from liquids-rich unconventional plays in the U.S. were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production was down 147 million cubic feet per day. As expected, lower U.S. production and field decline in several areas were partially offset by lower down time, mainly in Qatar and project ramp-ups.', 'Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 10, upstream earnings increased by $408 million versus the second quarter. Realizations increased earnings by $410 million as worldwide crude prices increased $7.67 per barrel and natural gas realizations decreased $0.53 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $150 million as increased liquids production was more than offset by the impact of underlifts in a number of regions including the North Sea and West Africa and by lower natural gas production in Europe. Other items had a positive impact of $150 million, primarily reflecting the absence of expiration cost reimbursement to Rosneft in the second quarter.', 'Moving to slide 11, oil equivalent volumes were down 1.4% sequentially. Liquids production increased 17,000 barrels per day mainly due to project ramp-ups in Canada and Nigeria and lower overall downtime, partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production was down 440 million cubic feet per day sequentially. Lower seasonal demand in Europe and field decline were partially offset by lower downtime in Qatar. Our year-to-date production volume performance continues to be in line with the projections presented at the analyst meeting in March, with strong uptime performance, increased North American unconventional liquids production, and higher European gas demand for the year offsetting the slower than anticipated ramp-up of Kearl. We remain on target to meet the 2013 volume outlook presented at the analyst meeting.', 'Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 12, downstream earnings for the quarter were $592 million, down $2.6 billion from the third quarter of 2012 due to lower global refining margins of almost $2.4 billion. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $150 million driven by lower refining maintenance. Other items reduced earnings by $380 million including the absence of gains from the Switzerland divestment.', 'Turning to slide 13, sequentially, third quarter downstream earnings increased by $196 million. Lower global refining margins decreased earnings by $870 million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $500 million reflecting reduced maintenance activity. Other items increased earnings by $570 million primarily due to the absence of the Dartmouth refinery conversion costs, lower maintenance expenses and favorable foreign exchange impacts.', 'Moving now to the chemical, financial and operating results and starting on slide 14. Third quarter chemical earnings were just over $1 billion, up $235 million versus the prior year quarter due mainly to stronger margins from higher commodity realizations in all regions.', \"Moving to slide 15, sequentially, chemical earnings increased by $269 million. Improved commodity margins helped by favorable feed cost in the U.S., increased earnings by $110 million. Strong U.S. commodity sales volumes further increased earnings by $60 million. Lower costs associated with Singapore's new steam cracker start up and lower plan maintenance favorably impacted earnings by $100 million.\", 'Moving next to the third quarter business highlights beginning on slide 16. The next two slides provide an update on upstream projects which recently started or will start production next year. Beginning with the 2013 project startups, at Kearl we are currently producing at or above 100,000 barrels per day. Over the past few months, we have undertaken normal startup-related fine-tuning and synchronization activities of our facilities, which are not unusual for new operations of this scale and magnitude. Kearl incorporates a number of technology innovations such as our proprietary froth treatment process, which significantly enhance environmental performance and reduce capital investment. Successful application of this new technology was confirmed as Kearl bitumen is now being processed at a number of ExxonMobil and third party refineries.', 'The Kearl expansion project is on budget, on schedule and now nearly 60% complete. Fabrication and assembly of pipe rack and equipment modules for the bitumen processing plant are progressing in Edmonton and are 80% complete. Learnings from the initial development are being applied to the construction and commissioning of the expansion project.', 'On the logistics side, Enbridge initiated construction of the Woodland Mainland Pipeline which will extend 385 kilometers south of Cheecham to the Edmonton terminal and connect with refineries and export pipelines. This new pipeline will have an initial capacity of 400,000 barrels per day, with the ability to expand to approximately 800,000 barrels per day depending on crude viscosity.', \"The Kipper Tuna Turrum project in Australia has started, with gas production from the Tuna field via two new gas pipelines and first oil production from the Turrum field through the new Marlin B platform. This project represents the largest new domestic oil and gas development on the Australian Eastern seaboard. With reserves of 1.6 trillion feet of gas and 140 million barrels of recoverable oil and gas liquids, Kipper Tuna Turrum will help secure East Australia's energy future.\", 'First production from Kashagan was achieved in September and production ramped up to near 80,000 barrels per day. In late September and, again, earlier this month traces of gas were detected along the onshore gas pipeline route from one of the production and drilling islands to the onshore processing facility. The operator is currently investigating the root cause of the events, and it is now anticipated that inspection and investigation will take some weeks to conclude. Production will remain shut-in until this work is complete.', 'Turning now to slide 17 and an update on some of our projects scheduled to start up in 2014. The P&G LNG project is now more than 90% complete. We achieved several important milestones during the quarter including completion of drilling at the first well pad and starting the commissioning phase at the LNG plant, with preparation of production startup in the second half of 2014. The plant has now been pressured up with gas to initiate power generation and enable testing of key facilities and equipment. The estimated cost of the project remains at $19 billion. Reflecting disciplined project management in a unique and challenging work environment.', 'The Cold Lake Nabiye development in Canada is 60% complete and progressing per plan towards a 2014 startup. This is another long plateau development which will access a resource of 280 million barrels of oil and produce an additional 40,000 barrels of bitumen per day. The Nabiye includes a new steam plant, field production pads and associated facilities. Equipment installation is well underway, and six of the seven initially planned drilling pads with 24 wells each have been completed to date.', \"Moving next to Qatar, the Barzan project is another major step in our long and successful relationship with Qatar Petroleum. All of the 30 production wells are now complete and the well-head platform topsides have been installed. Startup is planned for late next year. When completed, the project will provide gas to the state of Qatar to meet the country's growing need for clean-burning natural gas. The first phase of the project is to supply about 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas per day together with the sale of associated condensate, LPGs and ethane.\", \"Also in Qatar the Helium 2 plant project operated by RasGas started up during the quarter. The plant is expected to produce 1.3 billion cubic feet per year when fully operational. The Helium 2 plant is the world's largest helium refining facility and makes Qatar the largest exporter and second largest producer of helium in the world. As Qatar continues to reliably supply international markets with LNG extracting helium from the produced gas is a profitable value added activity which helps meet the world's ever growing demand for liquid helium.\", \"Turning now to slide 18 and an update on our progress in Russia, I will start by highlighting another milestone in the successful Sakhalin 1 development. The consortium marked 10 years of drilling success, pioneering the industry's extended reach drilling technologies while leveraging ExxonMobil's 90-year history of Arctic expertise.\", \"Since 2007, a number of world records in extended reach drilling have been set by the Sakhalin Yastreb rig at the Chayvo and Odoptu fields. To date 23 of the 30 world's longest extended reach wells are Sakhalin-1 wells. The current world record is held by a Sakhalin-1 well, which was drilled at the Chayvo field earlier this summer to a length of 12,700 meters. ExxonMobil's proprietary technology has minimized drilling vibration and improved overall economic efficiency, while reducing the environmental footprint of the Sakhalin-1 project. The relentless emphasis on safety, flawless execution and implementation of unique drilling technologies have made Sakhalin-1 a premier project in the global oil and gas industry.\", 'Now turning to our Arkutun Dagi, this will be the largest offshore oil and gas production platform in Russia, making the Sakhalin shelf a model for arctic and subarctic project developments. Construction of the topsides was completed in Korea earlier this year and commissioning of the drilling rig and topside facilities are 40% complete. Installation of the topsides onto the gravity-based structure next year will set a new world record for floatover installation offshore at 42,000 tons. Startup is planned for the end of next year and production will peak at around 90,000 barrels per day.', 'In West Siberia, operations for the pilot program are underway. Instead of drilling new wells, we entered and deepened existing well bores which has sped up the process to acquire new petro-physical log data and core samples. This information will help identify key produceability parameters for the Bazhenov and will help optimize new horizontal drilling locations planned for 2014.', \"In preparation for exploration drilling in the Kara Sea the Rosneft-ExxonMobil joint venture recently completed a month-long ice defense field trial to test sea ice and iceberg tracking systems that will be used to protect the drilling rig. All operations were successful and completed safely. ExxonMobil's arctic leadership and continued successful execution at Sakhalin-1 position us well as we prepare to ramp up the exploration program in the Kara Sea in 2014.\", 'Also in the Black Sea, site surveys were completed in preparation for drilling to begin in late 2014 or early 2015.', 'Turning now to slide 19 and an update on our global and broad exploration program. In September, drilling started on the Mronge-1 wildcat in Block 2, offshore Tanzania. The Mronge-1 well targets reservoirs equivalent in age to those successfully tested by the Zafarani and Lavani wells, in addition to another reservoir interval previously untested in Block 2. Further wildcat drilling is planned for 2014.', 'In Argentina, ExxonMobil spud the first operated well on the Baho Del Choique block targeting the Vaca Muerta formation. This is the first of three ExxonMobil operated wells that will be drilled in sequence on the block.', \"In Canada, ExxonMobil, in partnership with Imperial oil, acquired ConocoPhillips' interest in the Clyden oil sands lease. The Clyden lease is near Imperial's corner lease holdings and contains 226,000 gross acres of high-quality oil sands amenable to the steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, in-situ recovery technique.\", 'Turning to Brazil, ExxonMobil was awarded the interest it successfully bid for in May. ExxonMobil acquired a 50% interest in the Potiguar 762 block and a 50% interest in the Sierra 603 block, totaling more than 750,000 gross acres offshore northeastern Brazil. ExxonMobil will be the operator for both blocks.', 'In Gabon, ExxonMobil has reached agreement to acquire a 30% participating interest in the offshore Arouwe Block. The operator Perenco along with the third-party equity holder, Tolo, is planning a wildcat well in 2014.', 'Turning now to slide 20 and an update on our North American liquids activities. In the Permian basin we are ramping up activities to develop both conventional and unconventional reservoirs across our leading position of 1.5 million net acres. We currently have eight operated rigs and have turned almost 100 wells to sales this year across the entire basin. Current net production is more than 90,000 barrels per day.', 'More than 65 workover rigs are also active on our Permian properties, increasing production by opening additional zones and performing fracture stimulation treatments. We are also optimizing development and expanding infrastructure in our CO2 projects in the central basin platform area in order to enhance oil recovery. We also continue to actively evaluate unconventional potential across our Permian acreage highlighted by the Wolf Camp, Wolf Bone, Wolfberry, and Bone Springs reservoirs.', 'In the Bakken play, our gross operated production recently hit a record 65,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. For the quarter, oil equivalent production increased by 81% over the prior year quarter driven by a record 85 wells turned to sales year-to-date and the 2012 Danbury transaction. This volume increase reflects the benefits of well pad development drilling and optimized well completions across our core Bakken acreage.', 'In the Woodford, well results continue to be strong with peak 30-day equivalent production rates up 17% year-to-date. For example, a recent five well pad completion had a peak seven-day production rate just below 4,000 barrels of oil and 13 million cubic feet of gas per day. We also continue to develop infrastructure for our growing liquids production, recently putting in service a 65-mile oil-gathering pipeline in the Ardmore area.', 'In conclusion, in the third quarter, we earned $7.9 billion, generated $13.6 billion in cash flow, invested $10.5 billion in the business, and distributed $5.8 billion to our shareholders. Business performance remains strong across our portfolio.', 'In the upstream, we increased liquids production from project ramp-ups and lower down time. Total production volumes are on target to meet the full-year outlook provided at the analyst meeting.', 'In the downstream refinery throughput increased upon successful completion of the significant planned maintenance activities in the second quarter. Chemical business results remain strong, on increased commodity product demand and lower feedstock costs.', 'Across the corporation CapEx is in line with anticipated spending plans. Our cash flow remains strong and enables robust shareholder distributions. We maintain a long-term perspective on our business with a relentless focus on operational excellence and disciplined investing through the business cycle. As discussed in the business highlights, we continue to progress a unique and diversified set of profitable growth opportunities, which position us well to deliver long-term shareholder value.', 'That concludes my prepared remarks.

We still have negotiations ongoing, and we'll just have to see how that bears out.\", \"We also, in the area, have a pretty good opportunity set in terms of exploration, and we have had some success there recently and we continue to evaluate that opportunity, so that's still a possibility.

Not just down at the LNG plant side, but up in the highlands. So there's still a lot of kit to put together and test. But, again, all of that is ongoing. We're finishing up the pipeline.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.\"}}, {'@id': '1', 'plist': {'p': [\"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call. My conference this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Consistent with our recent Analyst Meeting, you'll note additional detail in our press release and this morning's prepared comments. Our objective is to provide clarity on key business drivers in the quarter and describe progress being made to deliver on value-growth potential outlined in the Analyst Meeting. In the interest of time, I'll move through the prepared material efficiently to ensure there's sufficient time for your questions.\", \"Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide 2. Please also see the supplemental information included in today's presentation.\", 'Turning now to slide 3. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our first quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $4.7 billion in the quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $10 billion, the highest since 2014. Importantly, cash flow exceeded net investments in the business, distributions and other financing activities by almost $3 billion.', \"In the United States, we achieved positive Upstream earnings of about $430 million. In Papua New Guinea, facility shut-in resulting from the earthquake reduced this quarter's earnings by about $80 million and volumes by 25,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. We have since resumed production and expect to reach full capacity in early May. As I'll discuss shortly, we made good progress during the quarter in a number of areas that will support our value-growth potential.\", \"Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of our financial results. As indicated, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings were $4.7 billion or $1.09 per share, up 16% from the prior-year quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $10 billion, including $1.4 billion in proceeds from asset sales that I'll discuss shortly.\", 'In the quarter, the corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Our CapEx was $4.9 billion, up 17% from the prior-year quarter, resulting increased activity in the Permian consistent with our growth plans. Debt was down to $40.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and cash increased to $4.1 billion.', 'The next slide provides a high-level look at the key drivers for these business results. In the Upstream, we benefited from higher realizations for both liquids and natural gas. However, our liquids realizations rose less than the benchmark prices due to widening of the Canadian heavy oil discount. These higher prices resulted in lower volume entitlements. Production was also reduced by downtime in the quarter and divestment of assets.', \"We're continuing to progress growth initiatives as outlined in our Analyst Meeting, including increased drilling in the Permian, advancing attractive new projects, and completing maintenance activities to enhance performance of our existing assets.\", \"Finally, we're actively strengthening our portfolio through the acquisition of new assets such as exploration acreage offshore Brazil. We also captured incremental value through divestments of assets.\", 'Refining margins remained strong in the Downstream, especially in North America. However, petroleum product demand was seasonally lower. U.S. manufacturing reliability recovered from the fourth quarter and notably Joliet returned to full capacity in March.', 'We also continue to make progress in growing our Chemical business. The integration of the Jurong Aromatics plant into our existing Singapore business is progressing as planned. In North America, sales are increasing with the ramp up of the new polyethylene lines at Mont Belvieu, supplying the growing demand for petroleum products. Within our base business, we successfully completed turnarounds in the Middle East and the U.S. Gulf Coast.', 'The next slide provides additional detail on sources of cash. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $10 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The positive adjustment for working capital mainly reflects favorable seasonal changes in payables, which were partly offset by an inventory build in the Downstream business mostly due to maintenance. Negative adjustment for other balance sheet items reflect timing of equity company distributions. Asset sales included Upstream properties, notably the Scarborough gas field, and Downstream distribution and retail assets. Note that cash flow was higher than the prior quarter, largely due to the higher earnings.', \"Moving to slide 7, I'll describe the uses of cash. Over the quarter, our cash balance increased from $3.2 billion to $4.1 billion. From our cash flow, we made shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and confirmed our commitment to reliably grow the dividend. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.82 per share, representing a 6.5% increase from last quarter and marking our 36th consecutive year of per share dividend growth.\", 'Net investments in the business were $3.3 billion, lower than the prior quarter due to the absence of acquisition payments. Debt and other financing items decreased cash by about $2.5 billion. This included $1.9 billion in debt repayment and $425 million used to purchase 5 million shares to offset dilution related to benefit plans and programs. In the second quarter of 2018, ExxonMobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs.', \"Moving to slide 8 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings of $4.7 billion increased $918 million from the previous quarter, excluding the fourth quarter impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments. Upstream earnings increased about $980 million, primarily due to higher prices. Downstream earnings decreased $12 million, driven by weaker refining margins. The Chemical business increased earnings by $76 million, primarily due to lower operating expenses. These were all partly offset by higher expenses in corporate and financing segment due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and higher pension expenses.\", 'Our total corporate and financing charges for the quarter were about $800 million. After further evaluation of the full impact of the U.S. tax reform, we expect these expenses to range between $700 million and $900 million per quarter for the remaining of 2018.', \"Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 40%, reflecting a higher proportion of non-U.S. Upstream earnings. Looking at the remainder of the year, we expect the effective tax rate to range between 30% and 40% at current commodity prices and the current portfolio mix. The increase in guidance is driven by Upstream's higher proportion of earnings.\", \"Moving to slide 9 for a comparison to the prior-year quarter, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings increased $640 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by higher Upstream realizations. This was partly offset by lower Downstream earnings, resulting from lower asset management gains and lower volumes due to the higher maintenance in the U.S. Chemical earnings decreased due to lower margins, and corporate and financing charges reduced earnings by another $270 million, again, due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and higher pension expenses.\", \"Moving to slide 10, we'll highlight some of the progress we've made over the first quarter that supports our growth plan shared at the analyst meeting. We made our seventh discovery on the Stabroek block, enabled by our proprietary subsurface imaging technology. The Pacora well encountered 65 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone. Pacora will be developed in conjunction with the giant Payara field. Along with other development phases, this will help bring Guyana's total production potential to more than 500,000 barrels per day.\", 'Development activities on Liza Phase 1 are progressing well. The Stena Carron is currently drilling the Liza 5 appraisal well, which will help delineate the greater Liza resource. A well test is planned at Liza 5 and will begin shortly. After the completion of the test, the rig will return to the Turbot area to drill a delineation well named Long Tail.', 'As previously indicated, we mobilized a second rig to the basin, which drilled the exploration well Sorubim in advance of the start of development drilling for Liza Phase 1. The Sorubim well reached total depth this week but failed to encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. We have additional exploration drilling planned later this year, as we continue to explore the full potential of the Stabroek Block.', \"In Papua New Guinea, a new resource assessment certified an 84% increase in the size of the P'nyang field, more than 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. These resources support our discussions with joint venture partners regarding a three-train expansion concept for the PNG LNG facility. One train will be dedicated to gas from P'nyang and two trains will be dedicated to gas associated with the Papua LNG project. This development concept would add approximately 8 million tons per annum, doubling capacity of our existing plant.\", 'As planned, we continue to increase our U.S. tight oil activity. We currently have 27 operated horizontal rigs in the Permian and four operated rigs in the Bakken. We remain focused on maximizing capital efficiency, drilling wells that are consistently longer than the industry average. Total unconventional production in the Permian and Bakken has increased by 18% versus the first quarter of 2017, with strong well performance supported by optimized completions.', \"With respect to our portfolio, we added eight new blocks offshore Brazil, which I'll talk about shortly, and signed agreements for deepwater blocks offshore Ghana and Namibia. As indicated, we continue to monetize assets, including our 50% interest in the Scarborough gas field. We also closed several Downstream divestments, including distribution and marketing assets in South America and retail sites in Europe. Further portfolio high grading remains a priority.\", 'In the Chemical segment, we continue to be focused on increasing capacity to meet growing demand for higher value chemical products. We began commissioning our ethane cracker in Baytown, Texas, with start-up planned midyear. This will enhance integration through lower feedstock costs for the associated polyethylene lines that started up in the fourth quarter of 2017.', 'Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide 11. First quarter Upstream earnings were $3.5 billion, an increase of about $980 million from the last quarter, excluding the fourth quarter 2017 impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments. Realizations increased earnings by $640 million. Crude prices rose just over $3 per barrel versus last quarter, but less than benchmark prices due to the widening of the Canadian heavy oil discount.', 'Gas realizations increased $0.80 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $130 million. The primary drivers for this were the effect of two fewer days in the quarter, higher downtime and lower entitlements, partly offset by project growth and seasonal gas demand. All other items increased earnings $470 million largely due to lower operating expenses and positive net asset sales. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $10.30 per barrel excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes.', 'Moving to slide 12, oil-equivalent production in quarter was 3.9 million barrels per day, a decrease of 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Liquids production decreased 35,000 barrels per day as downtime in Canada, lower entitlements and divestment of our Norway operated assets more than offset growth from new projects and work programs. In particular, we were pleased with initial results at Hebron where performance from the new wells have exceeded expectation.', 'Natural gas production decreased about 400 million cubic feet per day due to lower entitlements and downtime notably in Papua New Guinea. This was partly offset by higher seasonal gas demand and project growth volumes.', 'Moving to slide 13 for a comparison to the prior-year quarter. First quarter Upstream earnings increased $1.2 billion due to higher realizations. Crude prices rose $10.80 per barrel versus the year-ago quarter and gas realizations increased $0.90 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $190 million. Lower entitlements and increased downtime, specifically in Papua New Guinea, were partly offset by project volume growth. All other items increased earnings $10 million as net gains from asset sales were offset by higher operating expenses.', 'Moving to slide 14, oil-equivalent production decreased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Liquid production was down 117,000 barrels per day, due to field decline, the fourth quarter divestment of our operated assets in Norway and lower entitlements, partly offset by new project volumes. Natural gas production decreased 870 million cubic feet per day driven by higher downtime, lower entitlements and the decline in the U.S. This was partly offset by project and work program volumes.', 'Turning to slide 15, we provide an update on earthquake recovery efforts in Papua New Guinea. First and foremost, on behalf of ExxonMobil and in particular, our staff in Papua New Guinea, I want to extend our thoughts and well wishes to the people of PNG as recovery continues following the devastation brought by this powerful earthquake and its aftershocks.', \"The response to the initial earthquake, all of our production gathering, pipeline and processing facilities were safely shut down. ExxonMobil's humanitarian response to-date has included the distribution of food, water, emergency shelters and other supplies along with the transportation of medics into affected areas. We focused support on the most impacted remote communities neighboring our operations and have also made a donation to relief agencies.\", 'Our facility successfully withstood the magnitude 7.5 earthquake in late February and its aftershocks due in large part to robust design and the immediate and effective response by our people. Because of its location, we accounted for a wide range of seismic activity in the original design, engineering and construction of the PNG LNG project.', 'In mid April, ahead of our projected recovery timeframe, we announced the safe resumption of LNG production. The second LNG train started up this week, and the facility is ramping up to full capacity. LNG exports have also resumed.', \"During the period that production was shut down, we also brought forward and completed maintenance to our facilities that was planned for later this year, enabling more efficient operations in the months ahead. We're proud of the response of our people in managing this extreme event, and importantly, caring for the community.\", \"On slide 16, we take a closer look at ExxonMobil's current acreage position offshore Brazil, which positions us with significant high quality resource potential. You'll recall that last year we captured several attractive opportunities, including a combined farm-in and bid-round award for the discovered undeveloped Carcara field, which extends across both the BM-S-8 and North Carcara blocks. Carcara field contains an estimated recoverable resource of more than 2 billion barrels, for which the co-venture group is progressing development planning and activities.\", \"The group's near-term plans include up to 3 wells in the field, better delineate the resource and to find the development concept. As we shared at the Analyst Meeting, this proposed development yields attractive returns, even at crude prices of $40 per barrel.\", 'At bid round 15 held last month, we were awarded an additional 8 deepwater blocks containing multibillion barrel prospects in the pre-salt play, taking our total acreage to more than 2 million acres across 24 blocks. ExxonMobil operates more than 60% of these acreage holdings, and we will leverage our capabilities and proprietary technologies, maximize potential resource value.', 'We will be acquiring more than 19,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic data in 2018. Because we already have 3D seismic over some of the blocks, we are also progressing plans for the first exploration well scheduled for the latter part of next year.', \"Moving to slide 17, we'll now discuss Downstream financial and operating results. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $940 million, a decrease of $12 million from the previous quarter, excluding the fourth quarter 2017 impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments.\", \"Lower refining margins decreased earnings by $200 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $40 million mainly due to lower seasonal demand and higher maintenance activity, partly offset by improved operations in the U.S. All other items increased earnings by $230 million, mainly driven by lower operating expenses partly offset by the absence of last quarter's Norway retail divestment.\", 'Moving now to slide 18, Downstream earnings decreased $176 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. Margins were down $30 million due to lower non-U.S. margins, partly offset by higher margins in the U.S. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $60 million due to continued higher U.S. maintenance activity, mostly at Joliet, which resumed full capacity in March.', \"All other items reduced earnings by $90 million mainly due to the absence of asset management gains from last year's Canadian poor credit asset sale.\", 'Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results on slide 19. First quarter Chemical earnings were more than $1 billion, up $76 million versus the previous quarter excluding fourth quarter 2017 impacts from U.S. tax reform.', 'Weaker margins and lower volumes primarily due to turnaround activity negatively impacted earnings by $30 million each. Lower operating expenses and favorable impacts from foreign exchange increased earnings by $140 million.', 'Turning to slide 20, first quarter Chemical earnings were down $160 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker margins resulted in a decrease in earnings of $270 million as increased feedstock costs outpaced stronger realizations. Higher product sales from our new Chemical operations in Singapore and the U.S. improved earnings by $120 million.', 'All other items in the quarter included higher expenses related to new operations and other growth opportunities which were mostly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. These growth opportunities are a key component of our plans detailed at the Analyst Meeting.', \"Now turning to our final slide. The corporation's focused on growing value across our integrated businesses. Each of our businesses contributed to solid financial performance in the quarter, together earning $4.7 billion. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $10 billion covered our net investments and dividends with free cash flow of $6.7 billion.\", 'Upstream production volumes were 3.9 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, in line with our expectations. We expect second quarter volumes to be lower due to seasonal gas demand and then growth in the second half with project and tight oil volumes, seasonal demand and volume benefits from accelerated maintenance completed in the first quarter.', \"Total CapEx was $4.9 billion with no change to our guidance. We continue to strengthen the Upstream portfolio through exploration, acreage capture and selected divestments as well as disciplined execution of our investment program. In the Downstream, we are progressing our advantaged investments such as those in Rotterdam and Antwerp to manufacture higher value products, capitalizing on our proprietary technology in integration. And in the Chemical business, we're focused on growing sales of our differentiated products, supported by new assets that are well positioned to meet global demand growth.\", 'Finally, we remain committed to our shareholders as demonstrated by 36 consecutive years of dividend increases.', \"That concludes my prepared remarks. Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to note that in the remaining quarters of this year, one of our management committee members will participate in the call, provide further perspective on progress and key developments relative to our plans. The Chairman and CEO will participate in the fourth quarter.\", 'With that, I would now be happy to take your questions.']}}]}, {'@name': 'Q&A', 'speaker': [{'@id': '0', 'plist': {'p': {'mark': {'@type': 'Operator Instructions'}, '#text': \"Thank you, Mr. Woodbury.

I guess just to start on the overall kind of profitability spectrum, at the analyst day, you offered a pretty clear view that the Upstream contributions would be after the post-2020 long cycle development program is wrapping up and in the interim Downstream and Chemicals would carry a lot of earnings growth. I understand the slides clarified that the margin environment wasn't necessarily supportive of that in 1Q.

I highlighted in my prepared comments Antwerp and Rotterdam, which is going to take us out of lower value products into higher value products. We'll have Antwerp that will start up in the middle of the year and then Rotterdam will start-up by the end of the year. Okay.\", 'As well in the Downstream, we have continued to expand our entry into some high-growth areas such as Mexico and Indonesia. Everything is moving consistent with the plans that we laid out in the Analyst Meeting.', 'On the Chemical side, same story. We had laid out for you a plan of growth, commensurate with what we saw in terms of Chemical products. Importantly, as I indicated in the prepared comments, the Baytown cracker will be starting up middle of this year. It is really the second half of the overall project, remember the first half being the two polyethylene lines in Mont Belvieu, which have started up and have been ramping up to full capacity. And that will add a significant additional component to our Chemical portfolio.', \"You'll also recall there are a number of other investments that we've made in chemicals in Singapore. Importantly, we are making great progress on integration of our Jurong Aromatics acquisition. We see significant value there, and as the organization continues to integrate that into our big Singapore manufacturing facilities, we continue to see additional opportunities.

I know there's a lot of nuances in these contracts, and some of them are subject to some non-disclosures and confidentiality.

And that's what's most important here. And as I said on the volumes going forward, you can really think about our volumes contributions in 2018 coming from the areas that I mentioned, our project growth notably in places like Hebron and Odoptu and Upper Zakum, the tight oil growth that we've been advertising. We're making great progress. We said that we'd be there at about 30 rigs by the end of this year. We're already at 27 rigs, so we're really ahead of schedule.\", 'The second piece that you got to remember is that, as I alluded to, there have been a number of unplanned downtime events in the first quarter that we went ahead and took advantage of to accelerate scheduled downtime that we have in the latter part of this year into that first quarter to be more efficient.

Total operates those assets and we've been in very close coordination with our existing co-ventures and Total.

One is that we continue to make significant resource, additional resource captures with like I mentioned P'nyang. Earlier this year or last year, we went ahead and made a good discovery at Muruk, and we've got a well that was spud there later this year and we think it's very significant, very close to the Hides gas field. And then the last point I'd make is that we picked up a lot of good exploration high quality acreage in the Highlands, obviously through the InterOil, and then offshore of the LNG plant. So the message in all that is, is that we have built a very sizable, high quality resource potential in the PNG vicinity and that positions us for this expansion as well as maybe potential opportunities.\", \"In terms of the timing, that is yet to be determined. Obviously, there are a lot of different players in this and ultimately the resource owner, the PNG government needs to align with the plans and the timing of that.

Can you just talk about what you're seeing globally from an inflationary or deflationary perspective as you're ramping up activity here in your key areas?\", 'And then sorry if I missed this earlier, but in Guyana, Liza 5, was there anything incremental to share at Liza 5 at this point, and maybe how are you thinking about the size of that third FPSO as you integrate those results?']}}, {'@id': '1', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"Okay. Let me start with the last question first. In Liza 5, we're still early days. We're still, the well itself was within our expectations, and now we're moving into the testing program, so there's really nothing more to share on it. We still are holding a resource, a recoverable resource of about 3.2 billion barrels, but I'll remind everybody that that excludes any additional add from Ranger and Pacora at this point because we still need to do some more delineation drilling in order to update the resource assessment.\", \"All of that is being real-time integrated into our development planning for the subsequent phases at Guyana. The first phase, 120,000 barrel a day vessel. Second phase, it looks like, we haven't FID'd it yet, but it looks like it's going to be about a 220,000 barrel a day vessel. The third one, we're looking at it based on the data real-time. We haven't landed on anything at this point.\", \"But you can see what we're trying to do, is we're trying to get into more of this manufacturing routine like we've really benefited from in the past, like in Angola, is to really get to the point where you start designing and you start rolling out these comparable similarly designed facilities such that you maximize the value proposition there.\", \"But it's a very exciting time for Guyana. There's a lot going on, as you can appreciate, from an exploration all the way now to planning for production. So watch that space, and we'll provide updates as we progress.\", \"On your other question around generally the market and any inflationary pressures, clearly, there are going to be certain services or specific geographic areas that there are inflationary pressures. There's a lot going on in the Gulf Coast in the manufacturing areas that have put pressure on craft labor. In the Permian, obviously there's a lot of activity, and that's putting some pressure.\", \"But it's always about making sure that you stay ahead of all that and that you're positioning the business such that it can offset any type of pressures, and in fact maintain the focus on structural reductions in our business. And that really frankly starts all the way back to how you design these projects. But if you think about the Permian, by way of example, we'll continue to drive the unit cost down through our drilling efficiencies. It's all about capital efficiency, so that as you produce these assets through the life that you're doing it at the lowest cost.\", \"But there are areas that we continue to focus on. We are proactive in terms of our contract awards. We really look at the total cost of ownership to identify supplier cost reduction opportunities. We leverage bidding. We have a very robust supplier relationship management program. We've got the ability because of the financial flexibility of the corporation to accelerate and bundle equipment purchases. So it's all about making sure that we drive the cost down, which has historically been able to offset that inflationary pressure. Now, you may have some in certain places that we're obviously working through, but by and large it's what is the lowest lifecycle cost of our assets.

According to Mercury Research, integrated CPU eroded integrated graphics chipset market share, while discrete GPU attach rates remain constant overall. GPU attach rates actually increased in notebook from 33% to 36%.

And so that segment of the marketplace we see relatively strong.\", \"In terms of GPU attach rate, the GPU attach rate around the world is higher than the United States by far. For example, in China, the attach rate is about 80%. And in Europe the attach rate of GPUs in consumer PCs is about 60-some odd percent, 60% to 70%. Here in the United States, the attach rate is only in the 20s, and I don't know exactly why. Maybe it's because people have a greater sense of value outside the United States. Maybe people use their PCs for more digital content. But nonetheless, the attach rate is much, much higher outside the United States. And as you know, the growth rate of PCs outside of the United States is higher than in the United States. And so I think that our GPU position for consumers and in high-end notebook segments are doing quite well.\"]}}, {'@id': '0', 'plist': {'p': 'Next in queue is Craig Berger of FBR.'}}, {'@id': '12', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'Hey, guys.

Digital video editing is a very large market, and growing, and there's just so much more digital video content being created all over the world. And the third is global expansion, whereas the developing countries used to be a manufacturing-oriented culture and economy, it's increasingly a design-oriented economy. And so in order for movies and advertisement and products to be designed in China, they need workstations to do that. And so that's a really fabulous growth opportunity for us.\", \"And so we're seeing usage of workstations in more industries than ever. We're seeing that our GPUs can do more things. At SIGGRAPH this week, we demonstrated a workstation that has the ability to not only visualize, but also simulate and visualize in real-time with the technology we call Maximus, Quadro Maximus; and so all of these vectors are growth opportunities for workstations.\", \"Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised to see our workstation business continue to grow for many years to come.

This is a really an important day for us to be able to share with you what we're up to. As Trey mentioned, you have basically all of the Data Center group staff here, the general managers and vice presidents of the group. So it will be a great opportunity for them to get to know you and you to get to know them as well.\", \"So as Trey said, we are going to cover a lot of ground. We're going to start the agenda on the areas that are really the big growth vectors for the traditional microprocessor business, so the CPU business, Xeon. And then we'll go into three of the areas that are really driving growth beyond CPUs. We pick these three. These aren't the only three areas beyond processors that we're investing in obviously, but we picked these three because they're significant drivers of growth as well as they're new areas that may not be as well known to many of you. So we want to give you a drill down into those new spaces.\", \"So I always start with this slide, so I apologize. You've probably seen it 100 times now, but this is the way we look at the Data Center business. We look at it from the perspective of the end user, the people that actually procure infrastructure, deploy infrastructure, manage that infrastructure. Each of these have a slightly different set of value propositions that they're looking for, so it's important for us to keep the end user in mind as we develop our products.\", \"Of course, we provide service, storage, and network technology into each of those end-user segments. You can see our market segment share there. We're now at 96% share of the server market, so it's a very lovely share obviously. Storage we're up over 80%. That's traditional SAN/NAS storage as well as the ever-increasing scale-out or server-based storage that you hear so much about. And then the network space is the big opportunity for growth. We're at about 8% share now of a very large market and nice opportunity.\", \"And then we talk a lot about growth by segment, and these are obviously in not so precise numbers. They're not probably super helpful, but it does give you perspective that the enterprise markets is going to grow in single digits out through the future, but the other areas we see continued growth, CAGR of over 20%.\", \"And then last are the three big strategic focuses for us. These are big strategic growth areas for the industry, so it's not surprising that these are them. And when we – so the first is the move to cloud computing. And when we say the move to cloud computing, we mean that as a computing architecture. So it's the move to cloud computing of the big public cloud service providers, enterprise moving to private clouds, the communications industry moving to a cloud-based infrastructure. So we mean it as a computing architecture that is pervasive.\", \"High-performance computing, this is the area of how High Performance Computing solutions are being used in new ways that they weren't prior, so the democratization of HPC, and Raj will talk about that. And then big data as a growth driver, with just massive accumulation of data and using that data to drive good business results as well as new services.\", \"So recap of the first half, just for a reminder here, so we grew. If you look at the first half of 2015, we grew overall 14%. That was 19% in Q1 and then 10% in Q2. That variability I think reflects what we've been talking about for a while, which is each of those end-user segments procures infrastructure at a different beat rate. And so you see the variability quarter over quarter, particularly the cloud service providers. Acquisitions are driven by different dynamic than say enterprise IT. So you see these ups and downs in the quarter, as we've been talking about.\", \"Certainly, the underlying growth of cloud computing, you see that in the numbers as well. So that's a very strong first half in the cloud build-out. It's easy to talk about the big seven cloud service providers, the four in the U.S. and the three in China, but what we do see is diversification of that market.\", \"So the next tier, moving up into that top 10 space, many more players. China had a very strong Q2 in the cloud space, folks like JD.com or Qihoo 360, so you see some really big consumer growth, consumer service growth. And that's actually the other point I want to make here, which is when we talk about public cloud service provider growth, we see a pretty consistent two-thirds of the cloud infrastructure is going to consumer services and one-third going to enterprise-based services like Oracle or Amazon where growth would be heavily enterprise. That mix has been pretty constant over time.\", \"And then we do see very strong growth on the network side, and that's an exciting area for us. As the comms infrastructure moves off of proprietary infrastructure, fixed function infrastructure, onto standard high-volume servers in a virtualized environment, running in a cloud dynamic automated way, that move is happening. We see it well and Sandra will give you lots of insights into that.\", \"And then after seven quarters of growth in the enterprise space and a very nice Q1, we did see softening of enterprise in Q2. We still expect for the year will be good. We're not changing any expectations on our 15% growth for the year, but we are watching enterprise carefully. Some of it is likely China. China is the largest procurer of four-socket and above servers. So those are the very high-end servers, and we certainly saw that slow down in Q2. So we're keeping our eye on that, but the underlying growth drivers remain the same, and we're still confident on the year.\", \"So when we talk about how are we going to grow, how do we actually deliver that 15% CAGR, there are three big ways. The first one is on the server side. If you have 96% of the server market, you grow with the market, and we believe we have ways to accelerate that growth. It goes back to Jevons Paradox that we love to talk about; that if we can make infrastructure easier and more efficient, easier to deploy, easier to consume, there are new usages that will occur and the demand will increase. So that's a focus for us and it's a lot of what you'll hear about on the cloud build-out. You might have heard we announced Cloud for All initiative and some investments within that with Rackspace and Mirantis. So these are investments that we're making to make it easier to deploy technology. So we grow with the TAM and we take actions to accelerate that TAM.\", 'On the network side, it is obviously a share gain opportunity, a big opportunity for growth, as I just mentioned.', \"And then the third way that we grow and meet that 15% CAGR is through sell-up. So we continue to see movement of ASPs, and I'll talk about that in a minute. And then our increasing silicon footprint for a given infrastructure solution, growing our silicon footprint within that box. And those are the ways that we're going to talk about later today as well.\", 'So I want to just jump into the one point about continued increasing ASPs, so our ability to grow ASPs over time. We now see 80% of our volume, Xeon volume, the demand has gone up the stack, 80% of it since 2010. And that number was 70%, if you recall, at the Investor Day in November last year. So we continue to see this trend.', 'And you can say why is it; there are some really good reasons. As technology continues to become more and more critical to your business, even as technology becomes your business, it does like Amazon and Airbnb and Uber. IT is their business. Anything you can do to make that infrastructure more effective and efficient is directly delivering value to your business. So IT is no longer a support function and nice to have; IT is a critical business element. And so we see folks buying up the stack, trying to get greater and greater benefit out of their infrastructure.', \"And the way then we continue to deliver greater and greater value so that they see the benefits and buy further up the stack is through many different ways. We deliver value in the Xeon processor line in many different ways. And we do talk a lot in Intel about Moore's Law because we love Moore's Law. And that is certainly one of the ways, the ever-increasing performance and energy efficiency of the transistors as we move from process generation to process generation.\", \"But there are, as you could see, other very significant ways that we deliver value into our products that the end user wants to consume, and that's integration. We've been doing that for years, whether it's just adding more cores to a given processor, whether it's integrating the floating point unit from long ago. Eventually, as we go through the Altera acquisition, integrating FPGAs will be another great way. So that delivers big pops of performance gain.\", \"New instructions, so as a given workload becomes more and more mature, we'll actually add an instruction to the instruction set, and that can deliver huge performance improvements; for instance, TSX, which is a new instruction that we added in the Haswell product line we announced earlier this year that gives us 6x performance increase for applications that are parallel and memory intensive, so big data analytics will benefit from that. So on one instruction you'll get 6x performance improvement for that given workload.\", \"We also deliver greater value through just big new feature innovations. You remember when we introduced Hyper-Threading into our processors or turbo mode, and these give big pops of performance to the end user. And then we also have our custom CPU capability, where we'll deliver a processor directly to an end user to accelerate their particular workload. And that again will give them significant value that then they see the value in and they're willing to pay for.\", 'So many different ways that we deliver value, many different ways that we continue to increase the performance that we deliver processor after processor after processor, and then we see that reflected in our ASPs.', \"And then the last point I wanted to make is my statement of we grow by increasing our share of silicon footprint within a given system. So if you look, 2014, 88% of our revenue was from the Xeon processor product line and 12% from other, and other would be Ethernet controllers, chipsets, our Boards and Systems group. As we move forward, 2018, you can see 22% of our total revenue will come from other. And that is really a reflection of 3D XPoint memory solution that you'll hear about, silicon photonics that you'll also hear about, and our increased fabric presence in High Performance Computing with the Omni-Path, and you'll hear Raj talk about that.\", \"Okay, so 2014 we were at $14.4 billion. If you look at the total logic silicon TAM, it's a $37 billion market, so that's the opportunity to grow our footprint. And then if you add in memory with 3D XPoint now, we look at our TAM as even broader. We're talking about a $49 billion market that we can grow into.\", \"So just to summarize then, this is what we've been saying for a while, 15% CAGR out through time. As you can see with the growth of the non-enterprise businesses at the pace they are, enterprise becomes a smaller and smaller portion of our total business.  And the way we do this, as I said, is within the server market grow the TAM, accelerate the TAM, grow with the TAM; network gain of share, as Sandra will tell you; and the then sell up in our silicon footprint.\", \"So that's the summary. And with that, as Trey said, each of the presenters will save time at the end of their sessions for Q&A, and then I'll come back at the end for Q&A as well. So with that, I want to introduce Raj Hazra. Raj runs the High Performance Computing Group and the Enterprise IT business as well, so he's going to speak though about HPC.\"]}}, {'@id': '2', 'plist': {'p': [\"All right, thank you, Diane. Good morning, everybody. Good to see some familiar faces, and I'm yet to know some of you that I haven't met before. My name is Raj Hazra, as Diane said. And today I'm going to talk about our High Performance Computing business, which again Diane mentioned is one of the growth areas for the Data Center.\", \"I'm going to talk about essentially three things. I'm going to talk about why this area, this market segment is poised for growth and investment itself. I'm going to talk about why Intel is best positioned in some respects in enabling and participating in that growth with our products and our innovations. And then I'll talk about our strategies to go take those investments out to the ecosystem and help the ecosystem realize that growth. And then I'll hopefully leave some time at the end for questions.\", 'So let\\'s talk about a little bit about the relevance and investment. So obviously, investment is and as measured by relevance. And when we look at High Performance Computing, we tend to start with governments. That\\'s typically where most of the investment has been. That\\'s typically where all – at least the visible press comes from. And if anything in the last two years, as this chart shows, and this is just the tip of the iceberg in some sense, the mantra of \"To compete, you must compute\" has become a universal mantra, which is basically rooted in the fact, in the recognition that we are now going into the digital age, and the world is a digital laboratory. You no longer want to build things, metal models or plastic models. You don\\'t want to manipulate things in the physical world. You actually want to use the digital tools of High Performance Computing to do that much more effectively and do that much more efficiently in the digital domain. And that\\'s really what HPC does, is it turns everything into digital putty.', 'So as you see, some of the things, some of the governments here that are leading this parade and \"To compete, you must compute\" and investing, I\\'m going to start with the U.S. National Strategic Computing initiative. The President signed an executive order two weeks ago, essentially one of the largest Department of Energy programs in order to go essentially create the next generation of high-performance computing technologies, but also the industry and the industrial base around it. So this is not just about creating that fast exascale supercomputer. It\\'s creating the capability for the U.S. industries and marketplace to use high-performance computing and those bleeding-edge technologies at all scales.', \"China has been in the news recently and for a while. They've had the number one supercomputer in the world for two years now, which in the world of top 500 as you'd call it is actually quite a rare achievement to hold on to that number one position because technology moves so quickly in this space. But they've held it. We are actually part of that system, enabling Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi coprocessors enable that. And they're investing massively in that same mantra of actually creating the capabilities, the basic capabilities to both create HPC as well as consume HPC. So a lot of investment going into applications and even training students to be the next generation of programmers and application developers.\", \"Europe has taken a very steady but maybe a little bit more quieter approach to creating HPC as a tool for fundamentally changing the way the industrial base competes. They made the recognition that there is a large imbalance between their use of HPC for European, large European industries to small and medium business versus their creation of IP in this space. And so they're funding very significant pan-European as well as country-specific programs into creating more HPC capabilities at the European and the national levels, and that's really the Horizon 2020 program.\", \"And then India about a year ago announced a $730 million program. And the goal of the program – it's very similar to the U.S. program, was to create – this was the second largest – the largest national investment in science since the space program in India essentially at this scale, to essentially upgrade the entire industrial base to a digital base, make HPC the tool available. So we see tremendous not just innovation, but tremendous policy and other related things becoming tailwinds in the acceleration of HPC innovation and HPC adoption.\", \"The second space is commercial. This is the space where HPC has been used for a long time, and it continues to be. And it actually has accelerated over the last couple of years, driven by two things, and this is a theme you'll hear throughout the day. New technologies give new capabilities. So these are bleeding-edge applications, whether it's a design application or it's an oil and natural gas application or it's a basic physics modeling or chemistry problem. New capabilities allow for new science, better science.\", \"And sometimes, even if you're doing the same thing, new capabilities give you a TCO improvement, given the amount of performance we pack in, in every generation. Refreshing your infrastructure even if you're not going to run new applications is a tremendous benefit in HPC supercomputing or HPC centers, but generally it's the former. There are application areas waiting for more compute. In very few cases we have the luxury of saying software and algorithms are so far ahead they're just waiting. My customers tell me give me 10x, 100x, I can use it. And the reason for that is in certain sectors of science, applications have now come to their glass ceiling of what they can do with current generation and are poised to actually turn over to the next generation of algorithms.\", \"Overlaying all of this fundamental change is the notion of data-driven high-performance computing. This is big data or, as you would say, big data. It is this notion that it is no longer just about physical models. It is a fact that there's tremendous insight and knowledge available in the data at large, whether it's generated by machines or it's generated as a course of other transactions, and insight can be gained by processing that. And that's actually an adder-on and we believe a new class of workloads that demands high-performance computing infrastructure for certain classes of data analytics in decision support and other areas. Time to solution and the efficiency of that solution is a differentiator.\", \"And you can see there are people who are doing studies. One of these is a market participation survey, where people actually are now looking at the business case of deploying HPC. A dollar of HPC investment, what does it return, whether it's through an efficiency, whether it's through effectiveness, whether it's through just innovation and competitiveness, $356. This is a fairly broad-based survey, and we can make that available through Trey and company. But what it says is when you go digital, when you get more efficient, you become more competitive. It's a better and a newer way of doing things at all scales.\", 'The third one, and this one is also very much in the center of our hearts and our backyard, is the notion of HPC getting democratized, the reach of HPC expanding significantly through what Diane called the cloud architecture for computing.', \"Just about two years ago, if you went to any cloud space, cloud service provider and asked about HPC, you would have gotten what is that? If you went to a traditional HPC center like a U.S. National Lab, they'd say why cloud? That world has changed. The TCO benefits of a cloud-based infrastructure are now being recognized in traditional supercomputing infrastructure, HPC infrastructure.\", 'More importantly, the ability for the cloud to take HPC not as this esoteric difficult thing but as a service, as a consumable service, and reach new users is tremendous. And so we are seeing the major cloud service providers in just about two years, 15% to 20% depending on how you count a little bit, of HPC actually being consumed in the cloud. And all the major service providers are looking at this as a fundamental differentiated workload for their infrastructure.', \"Okay, so with that, we go – okay, so it's obviously not going away, growing, and becoming more important. What does that mean for Intel? Maybe this foil is a little bit backwards, as you need to look from bottom to up, but the fundamental message is this. What we sell into – what we've participated in the market was through processors in the past, and we've enjoyed – by IDC's latest measure we had about 94% market segment share on processors. x86 has democratized HPC over the last 10 years. HPC has been democratized by x86 and Linux, the open source movement. And this is like the old mainframe is going to industry-standard servers, the same thing happened.\", \"But as increasing energy efficiency and performance needs have dominated the effectiveness of HPC usage and effectiveness and efficiency of that usage and workloads have become more complex, there has been a need to have that kind of focus be applied to other parts of the system. It's a full system-level design of what kind of compute you need, what kind of fabric you need, what kind of storage you need, and all of those become central to providing the HPC user experience.\", 'Fundamental to that are two things. One is integration. Diane talked about integration just a few minutes ago as a fundamental way we continue to deliver more value. Nowhere is it probably more critical than in HPC or hyperscale. Why, integration drives down cost, integration drives down power, and integration allows for better use of system resources to provide higher capability sooner.', \"So I'm going to talk about the second part that is critical, which is customization. As you integrate, and I've had this question from several of you in the past, it's all going then. It's commoditizing at some level or horizontalizing. What happens? Our design methodology and our approach to the ecosystem is as we integrate, we provide the ability to actually have targeted customization. So what we enable our customers to do is differentiate where they can and where they want to and not have to pay the burden of an entire lift of the infrastructure that is not differentiated. So I call it R&D OpEx optimized customization process. We will apply that to the three main areas that are fundamental to continuing to drive HPC forward and continuing for us to grow with the market.\", \"Obviously, Xeon remains a mainstay, and Xeon-based systems are now at 94%. It dominates the top 500. It's also used down to the departmental cluster size. In 2012, we introduced the Xeon Phi coprocessor, which was called the Knights [Corner] family. It actually won its biggest thing in being part of the number one supercomputer in the world. But we announced that we will be shipping the second generation of it, not just as a coprocessor but also as a processor, next year. And that has received tremendous uptake from again that waiting community of highly parallel algorithms that wanted the next generation of jump in energy efficient parallel performance.\", \"And the third one is fabric. What we've done is we've, based on our Cray and QLogic acquisitions from a few years ago, we've created the capability to build an entirely new fabric of Omni-Path optimized for high-performance computing and integrated it with our Xeon and Xeon Phi family of processors and coprocessors.\", \"Across these three, obviously we enjoy a very strong position in Xeon. The other two are strong headroom for growth. As you can see from this chart, in just about two years we've more than doubled our volume market segment share in coprocessors. This is a sign of two things. One is that our value proposition is strong with end users. And number two, the market also has grown for highly parallel applications.\", 'We are starting to see that with fabric as well. When we introduced the Intel version of InfiniBand, we were a generation behind our competition in speeds and feeds. Yet we almost doubled market segment share because of the value proposition of it being tuned and available in an end-to-end optimized Intel architecture system.', 'So we see these being fundamental needs of systems, of HPC systems going forward. We have tremendous technology and the ability to integrate and customize these products for a wide variety of workloads.', \"So what's our strategy? I talked a little bit about the leadership innovation in the silicon components. We will continue to ensure that the high-performance workloads run best on Intel. And that's not just a compute statement, that's a statement that says the system architecture will run best with Intel, whether it's Intel processors, coprocessors, fabric, silicon photonics, next-generation memory, or storage.\", \"The second is how do we take these innovations and continue to facilitate an ecosystem that can build products and solutions around it and deploy them effectively to the marketplace. About six months ago we announced this notion of a single-system architecture that actually takes the ingredients and the architectural approach to building a traditional HPC system, which is a simulation-based system, and turning that also into a high-performance data analytics solution. Big data is not all HPC, but there are certain applications of big data like machine learning that can really benefit from distributed high-performance infrastructure. Essentially, it's an awesome HPC workload.\", \"And so that's what we did. Instead of bifurcating, we said what we can do is, with these ingredients and the architectural approach, we can actually build a design surface and use the consistency of the surface to actually optimize for various kinds of workloads. This is tremendous from a software ecosystem perspective because the ecosystem does not like fragmentation. The ecosystem wants consistency and the ability to have targeted optimizations.\", \"What we've also done is taken that approach, which made us very successful in the traditional infrastructure space, and extended that to the cloud. How does a cloud service provider not only effectively and efficiently implement an HPC solution in their software-defined infrastructure, but also how do new software developers who are now called SaaS in that world, deploy their software applications as a service in that infrastructure. And then how does it all come together so that the end user that uses that service does not have to realize that there was any penalty paid for being in the cloud because it is a very performance sensitive infrastructure?\", \"The third one is really about applications. And in many ways, this is one of the most important things that we've done for the last 30 years, and we will continue to have to do. This is about working the application base and the ever-growing application base that runs on high-performance infrastructure and optimizing that for the latest technology innovations, parallelism, threading, vectorization, the better use of integrated fabric. The next-generation memories that get integrated have all provided very different interesting models for applications to use.\", \"How do we get that code modernized, and that has been a huge effort for us. Along with the industry, we have more than 50 parallel computing centers where we work directly with the owners of code, whether it's public domain code, or it's even applications written by ISVs, and optimize – help optimize them, not just at a single-node level, but at a cluster level, so that we can actually expose the goodness of things like fabrics and distributed storage. We have received tremendous support in this from the ecosystem, and we will continue to do this because it is fundamental to bringing together innovation from us and our partners and realizing value for end users in the marketplace.\", \"And with that, I'll stop and wait for questions.\"]}}]}, {'@name': 'Q&A', 'speaker': [{'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'All right, so questions. Yes, David?'}}, {'@id': '3', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': \"On Xeon Phi, can you give us any numbers, attach rate of Xeon Phi to HPC systems, the unit growth or the dollar growth that you've seen over the last year, any parameters that you can help us with?\"}}, {'@id': '2', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"All I'll say is on generation one, we've met our expectations to get in the market, establish the programming model. On generation two, we are seeing very good demand, and it's again in line with what we'd expect for a second generation product given the state of the applications. One has to realize the use of the Xeon Phi product is much more determined by how many applications are ready for it. And as we work hard on that, the ramp rate of interest is actually in line. What I'll say is this is in line with our expectations.\", \"So the other place where the Xeon Phi initial attach has or interest has been is where obviously the performance density of Xeon Phi pays off, number one. And number two, applications can be – are self-written for it. This is typically at the high end of supercomputing. And over the last – since 2012, when we introduced the first generation, we have introduced more FLOPS into the top 500 than any other competitive accelerator, as you'll hear Rob today approach in the top 500. So today, more FLOPS run on Xeon Phi than any other accelerator in the top 500.

And it's a little bit apples and oranges because we are on generation two, and most of our competition, specifically the GPGPUs, have been in the market for seven years.\", \"Here's what I'll say to the heart of your question around why Xeon Phi, because that's really the question, when you have a choice. The reason you have Xeon Phi is for two things. One is you have the performance and the energy-efficient performance that's world class. Number two is you have the programming model that is a consistent programming model with the Xeon. Therefore, while you have to optimize code for a many-core architecture, you don't have to port it. So there is already a very large legacy of code that is ready for Xeon Phi optimization as opposed to all of that code which is predominately written for x86 having to be first ported to a different programming model. So the performance as well as the programming model consistency is what's making people go, yes, that's what I want to get if I want to accelerate my many-core applications beyond what a Xeon can do.\", \"And beyond that, if you have like an hour, I can walk through all the beautiful gizmos inside a Phi. And that's part of the reason, what you've seen is over the last three years since 2012, we've gained share, specifically on the high end of compute – of supercomputing rapidly because of the adoption. No one wants to buy one and not use it because – and it's so you have to match the acquisition rate with your deployment rate of applications and that's been easy.\"]}}, {'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Matt?'}}, {'@id': '7', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': \"Thanks, Raj.

And when people, one of those buying up, HPC has been one of the segments that's consistently bought up and consistently bought as soon as it was available, so they're a big part of our early ship programs.

I'm Jason Waxman. I run the Cloud Platforms Group here at Intel, and it's good to see some familiar faces. We've had the chance to chat in the past.\", \"I've been at this cloud business for a couple years already. And I can tell you that, if anything, it's continuing to get more complex. And one of the things that I want to try and do today is really help do two aspects. One is distill down what's really driving the growth in the cloud, really get to some of the statistics and separate some of the FUD from what's really happening, and then also to make sure that you understand our strategy and why we're doing what we're doing. So those are the two things that I hope we'll be able to accomplish.\", \"One of the aspects I want to make sure I get out of the way up front is that I'm going to be talking about cloud in two different contexts. One is we'll talk a lot about the service provider. You tend to think about cloud as Google or Alibaba, that's certainly one of the aspects we'll talk about with regard to cloud growth. But then there's also, as Diane pointed out, the cloud infrastructure growth, which is the combination of hardware and software that are designed to deliver services. And that cuts across the cloud service providers, across comms, across the enterprise. So I'll make sure I'm talking both and being clear whether we're talking in the service provider space or in the infrastructure space as we go through. Okay.\", 'So just to start off, a little bit about the backdrop, the state of the cloud today, so in 2015, when we look at the cloud, a lot of the cloud in terms of technology deployment from a service provider perspective, about two-thirds of that is consumer-driven services. If you think about search applications, if you think about things like Hotmail, if you think about Uber or PayPal, that drives a tremendous amount of compute deployment, about two-thirds as we look at the year 2015.', \"One of the reasons we bring that up is that I think you and a lot of folks out there are always trying to figure out for the industry the cloud dynamic, is it a good thing or is it a bad thing? And we tend to spend a lot of time very much focused in on the cannibalization of, say, the enterprise as one of the key topics. We'll talk a little bit about that. But when you look at two-thirds of the actual compute deployment going into consumer, that's really net good for the industry, that's overall TAM expansion, so we still continue to see that being a strong driver.\", \"Now when we look at the next five years, we actually see that a lot more of cloud is going to be addressing other types of applications, ones that are still pretty nascent right now. So even with as much talk as about private cloud, enterprises deploying their own cloud infrastructure, they're still pretty few and far between, and part of the reason is the complexity of the technology.\", \"We actually forecast though that by 2020, between 65% to 85% of all the workloads will be delivered through a cloud infrastructure. And again, I say cloud infrastructure not meaning cloud service provider. It means that we see comm service providers, enterprises – enterprises and cloud service providers all having their own clouds and the vast majority of workloads being delivered through that combination of technology because it's highly efficient and it also allows you to rapidly deploy new services. So what we're going to talk about is what needs to change in the industry to help enable that next generation of growth across those usages.\", \"I am going to spend just another minute though on the cloud service provider growth. As Diane highlighted, we look at this as one of the P&Ls within the Data Center group and it has had some tremendous growth. I mean we're talking over 50% compound annual growth since we started tracking this segment back in 2009.\", \"Now one of the things I want to highlight here and this is really just looking at the cloud service providers in terms of their deployment of technology. The bottom are we call the hyperscale. These are the large Tier 1 cloud service providers, the biggest in the industry, both in the U.S. and in China. And one of the things that's pretty remarkable is that you tend to think of the law of large numbers that at some point that that CapEx and that overall growth is going peter out. And I think from what we've seen, and this based off of units, so CPU units, we're continuing to see very, very strong deployment of technology.\", \"But the other element here is that green bar continues to grow, and it grows actually faster than the blue bar, and this is the next wave of service providers. It's the Ubers, the Airbnbs, even Apple iCloud, when you go back to 2010, it wasn't really even on the radar screen. And that green bar over the last three years is growing at 42% compound annual growth rate as opposed to 25% compound annual growth rate for the Tier 1s.\", \"So what we are also seeing, and I think this is good for the industry as a whole, is diversification; that there are new entrants coming into the market. And in fact, I was poring through some of my stacks last night. The fastest growing one in the green area is growing 8x in terms of their technology deployment year on year this year. So there are some real up-and-comers, there's always going to be new innovation in the cycle, and that's going to continue to drive this cloud growth.\", \"Now as I mentioned, it's not just about the public cloud service providers. That's certainly a strong element of the growth. But when you look at what enterprises are trying to go do, and this pie chart here shows a survey that if you were an enterprise IT, where do you want to go deploy your workloads? And this is one of many different surveys, but a lot of those enterprises for various reasons. It could be security, regulation, control. In some cases it's the economics. They want to deploy their workload within their own private cloud.\", \"And so we're seeing a tremendous amount of demand. And even though Intel doesn't sell directly to end users, we have relationships out in the industry where those enterprises, multinational companies are coming to us and asking us can you help out with the growth in the deployment of our public clouds – I'm sorry, private clouds. And the reason for that is that the technology is just too complex. And I'll highlight on some of those barriers in a little bit, but if we can reduce the complexity barriers, it means more people can deploy clouds.\", \"And that really was the genesis behind the idea of Cloud for All, and we really do mean Cloud for All. It means public cloud service providers. It means comm service providers and enterprises, and really working with the industry to deliver the right technology to allow more cloud growth. So I'll talk about that in a little bit, but you can see some of the partners that are already part of the program that we've been collaborating with, working on new reference solutions, working on ease of deployment of the technology, and actually also attaching Intel silicon value of course into those clouds.\", \"So let me click to the next slide and talk a little bit about the framework for Cloud for All. And this basically is the snapshot for what we're trying to go do, shifting to our strategy around cloud. We want to be able to service hyperscale service providers. We want to service the next wave, which is comprised of say SaaS providers that are public cloud service providers, but also the comms service providers. And then we also want to be able to see the enterprises being able to go deploy cloud. So each one of them has a different set of requirements, and there are three basic strategies that we're employing to help make sure that they all get what they need in terms of deploying the technology, and I'll cover each of those three in the subsequent slides.\", \"Now I want to distinguish between what it is that each of these different types of customers are requiring and what they're asking for from Intel. So if you look at a hyperscale cloud service provider, let's just take Google for a second. I'd love to say that Google is calling me on a daily basis saying hey, could you help me out with my software? We really could use some improvements, but they're pretty capable folks. And at the end of the day, what they're really looking for is they want a more efficient engine to continue to fuel their data centers. They're looking for every little bit of optimization across the entire infrastructure, from the silicon to the system to the data center itself. And so when you look and think about hyperscale cloud service providers, what they want from Cloud for All is they want optimization. They want to deliver the best cost of delivering the service, and that's why they come to Intel.\", \"The next wave, obviously we still would like that type of efficiency, but what they're trying to do is they want to be competitive, they want to be nimble, and they want to differentiate against for example other service providers in the industry. And they're coming to us for two different types of things. Some of it's again the hardware and the technology infrastructure, but the other aspect is they would like better software infrastructure out there in the industry. It's a little too hard for them to cobble together all of the integrated parts that say a Microsoft has the ability to go do. So we're trying to make sure that there is both software infrastructure out there as well as hardware infrastructure to allow them to compete.\", \"And then when you look at the enterprises that want to deploy their own private cloud, they really just want something that's going to be as easy and as integrated as they possibly can. In some cases, they may want something like a cloud appliance, but they really want a stack that's robust that they can operate like they're used to operating their enterprise, but it can be stood up in a very easy manner. And we are so far from that today, and it needs to be addressed. So those are the three different things we're trying to accomplish from a customer perspective.\", \"From a strategic perspective, there are three things that we're delivering. The first is that we want to optimize infrastructure across a full range of workloads. The cloud that we used to see back in 2009 was largely web storefronts, very, very simple, very, very focused and homogenous. The cloud we see today is running everything from high-performance computing to big data to lightweight cold storage workloads. And it's that heterogeneity that we have to help them go optimize for.\", \"And then the second thing, and particularly this is for the next wave and for the broad enterprise, we have to make the software infrastructure easier to deploy and more robust. And then what we want to do is align the industry. And this is something that we take quite seriously. When you have the type of market segment share that we have, you can grow by gaining share, but it's a lot easier actually to start growing by creating new usage and accelerating the overall market. And the way you do that is by making investments with partners, aligning and creating these coalitions, and driving standards. And so I'll talk through all three of these in just a little bit.\", \"So let me start with how we do the optimization for the full range of workloads, and I want to do a little myth busting here. When people think about the cloud, they tend to think of commodity because it's just a bunch of white pizza box servers all shoved into a rack and it looks like a giant commodity. But as Diane alluded to earlier, when you are investing that much in infrastructure, if you're say buying 100,000 servers on an annual basis, if you can get a 10% performance improvement, that's like cutting 10,000 servers out of your infrastructure. So those little tweaks make a big difference in terms of what they're delivering. And that's actually why while people think of it as commodity, they're driving for higher and higher performance.\", \"And what this chart shows, as we looked at our top seven cloud service providers, the public cloud service providers, and tried to track them each generation to each generation, were they staying at the same SKU level, or were they buying up the stack? So it's not just benefiting from Moore's Law, but actually trying to beat the benefit they get from Moore's Law.\", \"And what you can see is that green shows how much volume those cloud service providers are actually buying up the stack generation to generation to the point where last year over 80% of the volume was actually driven out up the stack. So that's been supporting the increased ASPs that we've seen from cloud service providers. But beyond that, it's also been the reason that we started thinking more about customization of SKUs and how we go optimize for performance. And so you can see that right now all of the top cloud service providers are doing some level of SKU customization with us. That, by the way, is now starting to move into how can you take some of our unique IP and embed it into the platform in one direction or another. So we're continuing to increase on that customization vector.\", \"Now we started to realize that you might be able to do some set of those engagements pretty well, but at some point you want to scale this model. And you think about the way to go scale that kind of customization, particularly at a silicon level, and that's where an FPGA comes in and is really quite a handy asset. Because now instead of having a specifically customized ASIC embedded into a piece of Intel silicon, you actually have something that's programmable. It's like a sandbox, if you will, that allows a cloud service provider to innovate and to optimize. So it again fits in very well with this overall strategy.\", \"And then the other thing that's been really great about optimizing is that the cloud service providers really just want to see the best silicon. They just want to see the best platform, and that's why they've been early adopters of ourselves. They drive, they've been great network customers. And our overall share of wallet in terms of silicon footprint into the cloud service provider is about 2x attach rate versus the rest of the business because they've been early adopters for our next-generation technology, and we expect to continue to see that. It's already showing out that they're also the parties that are interested in FPGAs and then looking at Xeon Phi and other technologies as well, silicon photonics. So they're a great test bed and really adopter for us. So this is bringing together how we optimize the silicon footprint and work with them to deliver the best technology.\", \"The second aspect here again for the broader part of the market is how do we make that software infrastructure easier to deploy, and there are two pieces to that. The first is making sure that the technology, the stacks are maturing. So if you look at a project like OpenStack, and you may be familiar with it. It's a great idea. It was born out of open source. There has been a lot momentum and hype around it for years. The problem is it's this loose confederation of piece parts. And if you go to an enterprise or you go to even a lot of cloud service providers, it's just not robust enough. It doesn't scale. And if you're a cloud service provider, you need it to scale to thousands of nodes. Today we only scale up to a couple hundred. And you want it to be automated. You can't keep throwing people at the problem, otherwise you're not really delivering a cloud. The whole economics from cloud is that it's highly automated. So those are the problems that we want to address in the software stacks when we work with various partners, and we also have a number of Intel engineers that are working on those problems.\", \"But then obviously, there's the part that's important to us in supporting our business, which is attaching the silicon footprint. So as we look to the 3D XPoint technology, as we look to Xeon Phi or other accelerators, having a cloud software infrastructure that's aware of that technology is going to be extremely important.\", \"You can think of cloud software, I like to think of it as like an air traffic controller. So you have a whole bunch of applications that are floating around, and you've got to figure out what's going to be the best fit to go land on that hardware infrastructure. The more intelligent that is, the better you're going to be able to utilize that infrastructure. And obviously, we want to make sure it does best on not just our Intel CPUs, but the full range of the portfolio. So this is the key to the second piece of our strategy.\", 'And then the third is something that we do quite well and has always been a key component to our strategy, which is enable a good healthy horizontal ecosystem.', \"I want to make sure I leave ample time here for questions, so I'm just going to sum this up pretty easy. We start with reference architectures; these are the recipes. We want to make sure that if you want to deploy a cloud, whether that's an OpenStack cloud or a container-based cloud on Docker that there is a proven recipe to do that at scale, and that's the reference architecture. You then take that reference architecture and you enable industry standards. So we bring together end users, we bring together technology providers, and we make sure that the standards that they want to use will be aligned with those reference architectures, and that enables choice in the overall ecosystem.\", \"And then the last is through our connections, we bring together various parties. And we brokered some of these deals. There are companies that you normally would not see standing next to each other if it weren't for Intel bringing them together. And we accelerate that route to market by taking that reference architecture, combining it with hardware from an OEM, maybe turning it into an appliance, and then having value-added resellers or system integrators accelerate that deployment across cloud service providers and enterprise.\", \"So again, to just reframe our strategy, it's about optimizing across the silicon portfolio and optimizing across the range of cloud workloads, making the software easier to deploy, so we can get the next 10,000 clouds out there in the industry, and then make sure that the industry is aligned so that we speed that accelerated route to market.\", \"And with that, I want to see what kinds of questions I can answer for you anything about the cloud industry, the trends, or what we're doing.\"]}}}, {'@name': 'Q&A', 'speaker': [{'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': {'mark': {'@type': 'ph'}, '#text': 'Yes,  Eric (59:55)?'}}}, {'@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': {'mark': {'@type': 'Inaudible'}, '#text': '(59:56)'}}}, {'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': \"We'll get a mic.\"}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Could you please repeat the question?'}}, {'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Right here, thank you.'}}, {'@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'The prior presenter said that most of the deployments, unit deployments on HPC were like scale-out DP.

To what extent is true optimization for them actually building their own silicon, and where do you see your value proposition to prevent them from doing that?'}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"It's a great question. And so one of the things that the ARM camp has going for it is that it certainly has numbers of vendors. So they're all jockeying for position, and we keep a close eye on them. We're now in multiple years of watching where it is that they're going to try and get early deployments. And we expect and this is happening that there will be evaluations. Someone's always going to look and kick the tires on something new. So there are always press articles about the next deployment. I think our goal is to try and make sure that investors ask, are they real deployments or are they the proof-of-concept eval type of thing. There are certainly a lot of evaluations. So far we haven't seen any big or broad deployments.\", \"And to your question about – there are two pieces to it. One is what's driving this, and then second what are we doing about it. It goes back to what is it that the cloud service providers prefer in what they buy. And so if you look at that chart that I mentioned earlier about why they buy up the stack is they really do value performance. And I think part of the original ARM hypothesis was that you could win on low power and low performance, but the reality is that's opposite of where they're buying. So I think part of the challenge is maybe targeting the wrong customer value angle.\", \"From an Intel strategy perspective, our goal is to make sure that we deliver the best value across every work where we possibly can, and we just literally don't leave any seams. And that's why we have Atom-based SOCs to be competitive there. In the midmarket we've got a whole range of Xeon E5 SKUs. And so every time I see an ARM benchmark that comes out, I look and I say you know what, I have a SKU that's lower cost, higher performance, better power, and I think we have something that can go meet that customer's needs.\", \"And then the last piece of it is just working really, really closely with the customers in this segment. I know and I respect the fact that they're going to go look for alternatives. That's what makes them great companies is they're always innovating, but we've just got to stay fast. We have to stay focused and make sure that we're delivering a better value at the end of the day.\", 'Yes.']}}, {'@id': '3', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'Thank you.

I will tell you that we've had an ongoing package effort for a while, even before we pursued acquisitions, so I can talk a little bit about that.\", \"Currently the attach rate for FPGAs in cloud is extremely small. There has been a lot of evaluation and kicking the tires. I think we're now starting to see on the cusp of a couple of cloud service providers that have usage models that they're interested in ramping that volume. So based on what I see in the industry, I expect over the next say couple of quarters to maybe next year to really start to see that ramp initially in any meaningful volumes, and even it's still relatively small.\", \"The usage models for it are where a customer has a workload that they can really, really tune something out of. So one of the best examples right now is machine learning. And this is based on a public paper that Microsoft did a great job of comparing FPGA usage on a convolutional neural network workload compared to a GPGPU. And they found that there was an order of magnitude better performance per watt, and that's why they're heading down that direction. But it's those types of workloads where you're doing a search algorithm or you're looking for images. It's a very high performance, repeatable action. That's where someone is likely to invest right now in a, FPGA.\"]}}, {'@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': {'mark': {'@type': 'Inaudible'}, '#text': '(1:05:28)'}}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': \"Yes, thank you very much.

I just wanted to come back to some of the custom SKUs that you're doing for the cloud service providers. Can you give us some sense what types of features you're customizing? Is it core counts, I/Os?

Thanks.\"}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"So the answer on what knobs we turn, it's like yes, it's all of them. Really we started on this a couple of years ago when we just started thinking about the idea that when someone has a single-purpose usage, they don't have to necessarily order off the menu. When someone is a good enough customer that has a big thing in a run rate business that we could go to do that type of customization? So it will be cores, it will be frequency, it will be power, it could be reliability. And we'll turn all of those different parameters. We'll also turn off I/Os in some cases if it's consuming power that they don't utilize. So we will literally look at pretty much anything we could reasonably do to tweak it.\", \"And part of the reason we're able to do that is, when you look at how we produce silicon in general for the mass market, we have to make sure that it can run anywhere. It's got to be highly reliable. I always say it's got to be able to run in a data center on top of Machu Picchu. That's the type of range and run any workloads. It's like a high-performance supercomputer on top of Machu Picchu. When you work with Google or you work with someone that has a very dedicated application, they control their data centers, they know their workload, and you can get much more dialed in and what I call low hanging fruit. You can find ways to further optimize that you might not be able to go do in a mass market SKU.\", \"Now with regard to your question about how do we manage the number of SKUs, obviously, we have to make sure we're not just cranking them out for low volume because then that would get unmanageable. So we do have our hurdles for what we think make sense to go do customization. We also obviously have a very good factory network, so our Technology Manufacturing group is tremendous and helping us go do that, but so far we're okay. I do think though if we were to try and do this for say 100 companies, it would get to be unmanageable. And that's where again having something like an FPGA or other parameters that allow people to innovate will allow us to scale much more broadly.\"]}}, {'@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'Hi.

There's one large cloud service provider that literally within a quarter of us giving them silicon they've toggled over to the next generation, which is unheard of when you compare that to enterprises. So it's nice in terms of helping us get our technology ramp. I think if you looked at our overall DCG businesses, you'd see that the ramp of new technology has accelerated.\", \"Part of the other thing that we've done in addition to customization is we've done early ship types of programs, meaning that when certain customers are ready that they're able to go ahead and adopt these things. So that's part of the dynamic, and it's still consistent with give me the fastest thing. This is a competitive advantage to me. If I can be first with Intel over the next service provider, this is meaningful to us. So it's been a good I think overall dynamic for us.\", \"Now with regard to upgrade cycles, it's quite a bit different. In an enterprise, they look at some point and say it's time to go retire these dusty machines. They're consuming too much power, and you put them out to pasture. They become lawn art or whatever they do. In the cloud service provider space, they generally tend to leave in place. And so it depends on the actual cloud service provider as to how they go do it. But for example, if you look at some of the large ones that do infrastructure-as-a-service, they'll just keep leaving that stuff in there. And they'll have legacy customers that are doing a certain EC2 instance as long as they possibly can, and they manage those prices to continue to utilize that stuff until it fails. So it's really more continuing to add on.\", \"And then when you look at that with our dynamic, they're just rapidly moving too quick. As soon as that next stuff is out, the other stuff is going to start to become brown bananas, so we've got to go make sure that we're not too far lagging on it. And I think that's really the overarching trend is that they want to be first to node, and they want to ramp over quickly and make sure that they do that transition in a way that they don't buy a lot of brown bananas.\"]}}, {'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'All right, maybe one last question.'}}, {'@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'Jason, a lot of us in the audience try to build cloud CapEx models by looking at the large hyperscale guys and aggregating up their publicly disclosed CapEx. How do we think about the spend with Intel within that? Because clearly I think Diane has made the argument that even when buying up the stack, it allows cloud players to actually spend less on CapEx. So if we look at your dollar of CapEx from Google, what percent of that did you get five years ago, today, five years from now? Not customer-specific needs, but just in general how do we think about that trend within the hyperscale business?'}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"So rough, and I use – I always like to cite James Hamilton from Amazon is a great guy. If you don't follow his blog, I highly recommend going there and looking at it. But I'll use some of the rules of thumb that he uses in his pie chart. Basically, for every dollar that large cloud service providers spend, about 50% of that goes to equipment. About 25% of it goes to power and facility. And then the other 25% is sliced up amongst a whole bunch of other types of things.\", \"And so that 50% I think stays relatively constant. I think if anything, it may have increased a little bit, maybe going up to closer to 60% – 65%. And the reason I say that is that the facilities space, they're getting really good at cheap facilities. It used to be that they built a data center; you're going to do a data center tour later. Now it's basically like they pour concrete, roll in trucks. So a lot of that overhead of the facility piece is coming down, and they're spending it on hardware. And I think then they go – where does the value add to go spend in hardware? And our rough ballpark of that share of wallet can range anywhere from 20% to 40%, depending upon the full portfolio that we're selling. So those are some heuristics that I think you can use that might help you out.\", \"The one thing which I will tell you, and I think we've had some of these conversations, is that some of the things you've seen published in the industry about CapEx flattening or coming down, we don't necessarily see it, and it may be for two different reasons. It might be that some of those reports don't capture the full breadth of service providers. I think they were focused in on a couple of big ones versus we see, like I said, that company that went 8x this past year, and they may not see that. And I think the second is that there may be a shift in the dynamic about the other plant and equipment versus the stuff that does the meaningful work, which is where we tend to participate.\"]}}, {'@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'Okay, great. Thank you.'}}, {'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Thanks, Jason.'}}]}, {'@name': 'MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION', 'speaker': {'@id': '11', 'plist': {'p': [\"Good morning again. My name is Sandra Rivera, and I run the Networking business for Intel. And I've been in the communications networking industry for a long time, and I can say that now is probably the most exciting time to be in network infrastructure. It is a market that's at an inflection point where we have a huge opportunity for growth at Intel and where we have a strategy to win.\", \"So I'm going to begin by talking about what do I mean by the network. So when you look at all of the devices that we use every day out to the data center, which serves up a lot of our content, in the middle is the network, which is made up of thousands of points of presence or sites, hundreds of different node types and protocols, and dozens of different vendors. And that infrastructure up until now has been built on purpose-built fixed-function appliances that do what they were deployed to do very well, but can't be adapted to do anything else, certainly not very easily. It's as if – if you look at a close to home analogy, running your e-mail on one computer, running your spreadsheets on another computer, running your PowerPoint presentations on a third computer, and running your Word processing on yet another computer. That's a very inefficient market model but that's a pretty good description of how the network is built out today.\", \"The infrastructure does represent a huge CapEx investment. The network service operators spend roughly $160 billion a year on equipment. And of that, there's about $18 billion of logic silicon TAM. So it's a tremendous opportunity for Intel and where we're focusing a lot of our investment for growth.\", \"So I wanted to paint the context of the business problem that we are helping to address. The service providers, the Vodafones, Verizons, the AT&Ts and China Mobiles of the world, they run roughly $2.2 trillion of services business. Most of that historically has been voice business. But with more and more users coming onto the network, more and more devices connecting to the network, you see this explosion of data traffic. Particularly, we take into account the different usage models that drive more data, like social media or video processing. And what you see, however, is that the ability for those service providers to exact revenue from that network is really flattening out over time. The value proposition of data versus voice in terms of what consumers and enterprises are willing to pay is actually creating what we call an upside-down business problem, where it will cost some time in the future, not the too distant future, more to deploy, operate, and maintain the networks than they're able to exact revenue from those networks.\", 'So they know they need to do something dramatically different. And they believe that the answer to that problem statement is to adopt many of the principles of data center and IT infrastructure and cloud that Jason just talked about and take advantage of volume server economics, virtualization technology, so you can pool the resources and the assets across a number of workloads, and of course take advantage of cloud technologies but also cloud business models. So what they want to do is to really have a much, much better approach to reaching the economies of scale, to continue to build out this network capacity and capability. They need a much better total cost of ownership, better OpEx and CapEx efficiency.', \"If you go back to my analogy of having all of these purpose-built boxes for each of those workloads, that equipment can sit idle for much of the time. In the access network, as a matter of fact, they can sit idle for as much as 70% of the time. So it's a very inefficient model where they're looking to get a lot better asset utilization by adopting these principles of server virtualization and cloud. And not only do they want to manage their bottom line and get better CapEx and OpEx, but they also want to grow their top line in terms of services revenue and the ability to deploy new services and capabilities for, which then they can extract more revenue.\", \"So in the network infrastructure space, what we're seeing is the evolution of new technologies built on what we know has worked in cloud and data center, and that is called network functions virtualization [NFV] in terms of virtualizing the appliances. So now rather than having a dedicated appliance to run the workload, you virtualize it and substantiate it in a virtual machine running on a standard high-volume server. This is called network functions virtualization.\", \"The other principle that's really taking root in the industry is that of software-defined networking, so the ability to automatically provision the network and those underlying resources built on, again, server technology in order to meet the needs of the different applications and workloads.\", 'So NFV we believe will do for networking what virtualization did for the server industry, which is unleash a lot of new innovation, as Diane talked about, really make it easier for innovators and developers to consume the technology and deploy a lot of new usage models.', \"So we're seeing this embracing of server technology across the entire infrastructure, in the wireless access, in the core of the network, and out into the enterprise networks as well. And in the wireless access space, as I mentioned, there's a lot of underutilization of assets because those network nodes are dedicated network nodes to do a particular function.\", \"And one of the examples I wanted to just draw out here is with China Mobile, who is building out their 4G and LTE network, and they represent many Tier 1 and Tier 2 and Tier 3 service providers across the globe. Today, if you look at a cell tower, at the foot of each of those cell towers is a base station. And it's the job of that base station to transform radio signals into digitalized data. Those base stations sit, as I indicated, idle for much of the time if you are in an urban area and everybody goes home at night. It's really sitting there idle until you come back to work in the morning. Or similarly, if you have a base station in a rural area and everybody has left and gone to work, it goes underutilized. And what we've done with China Mobile over the last several years and Alcatel-Lucent, which by the way is demonstrating here this afternoon, you'll see some pretty slick demos, is that we've virtualized the workloads in that base station to run on the standard server platform.\", \"And you get all of the economies of scale in terms of the server capability. You have the opportunity to innovate on top of that server and take advantage of a lot of the application developers and tools that are out there, and you're able to have an asset now that can be a shared resource across many different physical areas because now you're pooling those requirements in this cloud capability that you've created in that base station.\", \"In the core of the network, what we see is that anything that requires high-performance computing, which the core network running all of this data traffic, delivering all of the content, securing, managing, and storing all of our data requires high-performance platforms. And we've seen AT&T, which is clearly one of the market innovators and a Tier 1 global service provider, make a statement that by the end of this year 5% of their network will be virtualized. They're beginning to embrace this approach in terms of using much more server high-volume technology versus purpose-built fixed-function platforms. And they've also made a statement that by the end of the decade, by 2020, they expect that 75% of their network will be virtualized, not only providing much, much better CapEx and OpEx and better asset utilization, but also this platform of innovation, this ability to innovate new services and deploy them much, much more quickly than what you're able to do when you're deploying in hardware. This is innovation at the speed of software.\", \"When you look at the enterprise network as well, one of the things that we do in terms of our communications networking portfolio is that we use carrier-grade as a design point, which means that you have high levels of security built in, high levels of reliability, low levels of latency, and of course, high-performance packet throughput. All of that capability waterfalls in terms of value that the enterprise also sees in there in running their own networks. And one good example, of course, is the financial services industry, where if you can take out any of the latency in terms of that transaction, you're actually talking about millions – many millions of dollars at stake in terms of just high-performance low-latency trading. So they have all the same types of requirements that we've built into the communications network, the wide-area network, and we're able to then bring that value proposition out to the enterprise as well.\", \"So we have been investing for growth. Diane has been investing in our business for a number of years now, where we have opened up a market opportunity as we recognized and I would say was somewhat prescient that we saw the fact that we could use that same strategy in our industry, in the communications network industry that worked so well in terms of unleashing innovation and growth in the data center and the cloud business. And over the last six years, we've seen that we have been outpacing the market in terms of growing share, as Diane talked about, in the communication network infrastructure industry, and we see that continuing out in time.\", \"The network compute trends really favor a lot of where Intel architecture has a leadership position. We see that the market needs to continue to grow to keep up with all that traffic, all the demand, all the users, all the machine-to-machine, the Internet of Things. So this is an industry that's somewhat recession-proof. We continue to build out the infrastructure to service all of those requirements. But the approach that uses fixed function, not only on the platform but the silicon inside of the platform, is a very expensive proposition and takes a long time, and you have to know that you have a lot of volume on a particular workload to make it worthwhile.\", 'And we see the industry shifting from ASIC technology and purpose-built technology and network processors to CPUs, to general purpose processing that can be harnessed to run those same workloads in a much more cost-effective manner.', 'We also see the convergence of workloads. If you look at any networking workload, it runs four different processing algorithms, application, control, packet, and signal processing. But the opportunity to run all of those workloads on a single architecture, on Intel architecture really brings benefits to the developers, to the solution providers, as well as to the end users because you get to take advantage of a common tool chain, a broad availability of developers that then lowers your development cost, lowers your development risk, and speeds your time to market. So that workload convergence onto Intel architecture is a huge benefit for all the members of the value team.', \"As I indicated, we have been investing for growth. We've doubled our investment in this segment over the last couple of years. And just at the end of last year we crossed over the $1 billion mark, and we're on a nice trajectory for this year's results as well.\", 'So what is our strategy for transformation of the network? There are three pillars that we are driving out into the market. The first is we have a deep commitment to open source and open standards. We see this as a way to unlock much more innovation, increase the participation in the market, and to have a much broader approach in terms of the level of services and capabilities that are brought to the market. So we are a huge contributor into open source and open standards historically. Intel actually is the number one provider or contributor to the Linux kernel. And in this market, what you need is a carrier-grade Linux distribution to take into account unique capabilities in terms of serviceability and scalability and reliability. And we also make those contributions to the Linux Foundation.', \"But in addition to that, and Jason touched on this a bit in terms of what we're doing for manageability and orchestration for that intelligent workload placement of the application requirements to the physical substrate that you have running the infrastructure, and that's really where we make contributions into OpenStack. And of course, that includes not only the enterprise capabilities and features that are required, but also the carrier-grade features that are required and something that we call enhanced platform awareness, which is again, that ability to take advantage of the underlying silicon and software ingredients that will make the applications run better, faster, and smarter.\", \"In addition, we are deeply invested and a big believer in a broad ecosystem. Just two years ago, in fact, at the Intel Developer Forum of 2013, Diane announced the creation of the Intel Network Builders Community. And at that time, we had a couple of dozen member companies and a vision, a shared vision around this transformation that was happening in the industry. We have grown that now to over 170 members, 173 to be exact. And that community is made up of ISVs, software vendors, OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, and ingredient and solution providers of all types. But in the last nine months, we have now extended our focus to also add end users into that community. And the end users see benefit in terms of being in our community because they can help direct and focus the investments and the activities of that ecosystem to solve the business problems and the technical challenges that they're facing.\", \"And so in that end user community, we have companies like Telefónica and América Móvil, NTT, and SK Telecom, China Mobile, so global market leaders that are trying to drive faster innovation and focused investment. And just in the last three weeks, we in fact had our first enterprise end user join that community as well. NASDAQ joined Intel's Network Builders Community, again, to try to focus the investments around their specific technology and business challenges.\", 'One other value statement in terms of the benefit that the community is deriving from learning in community from sharing, best known methods and approaches from solving these problems together is that both Cisco and Ericsson joined Intel Network Builders earlier this spring; Cisco, of course, being the number one enterprise networking company in the world, and Ericsson being the number one wireless infrastructure company in the world.', 'And then lastly, one of the things that we know is that silicon development are long and expensive campaigns. And rather than just direct – or respond directly to the direct customers of ours, we in fact decided several years ago, many years ago now, to engage with the end user, so that we could be more informed and anticipate those requirements and build those into our roadmap and build those into our features and into our silicon development investments.', \"And so that started out as technology feasibility studies and proof-of-concepts and early lab trials. But now that is moving out to field trials and some of the early commercial deployments that we're seeing around the globe. In fact, just in 2015 alone, we see over 20 new commercial deployments across the globe from again communications, cloud, and enterprise service providers as well as more than 50 proof-of-concepts and trials continuing. So the momentum continues to increase.\", 'And of course, built on top of all this is our technology leadership as the foundation. If we look at again everything that we leverage and borrow from our data center investments, our cloud success, our innovation in all things server, we also then build on top of that capabilities that are unique to communications networking that are unique I/Os and more packet processing capability and cryptography for security applications and compression for storage capabilities.', \"So if you look at just some examples of that, packet processing is one of those workloads that is essential to any communications networking application. And with our optimizations in the Open vSwitch, which is really how you have switching from virtual machine to virtual machine, and our Data Plane Development Kit, which again are a set of software libraries built on top of standard server technology for high-performance packet processing, we've seen a 12x improvement in packet processing performance just from those two innovations.\", 'We also are building more into our roadmap, scaling up through Xeon and down through Atom, and in our SoC capability by having more integration, integrated Ethernet, integrated I/Os, integrated content processing capabilities. And then as I mentioned, from a software stack perspective, we also are innovating in terms of the requirements around a carrier-grade cloud stack and requirements that give you better serviceability, better reliability, and better security.', \"So what's on deck for the future? The innovation never ends, and 5G represents that true convergence of computing and communications. What we expect to see in the 5G timeframe, which will build out towards the end of this decade, in the next five years, is an order of magnitude increase in the terms of the number of connected devices. We're sitting at about $5 billion (sic) [5 billion] (1:36:27) connected devices and people today, and we expect this to be 50 billion connected devices with the Internet of Things. We see a 50x growth in terms of the data rates; again, more users, more devices, more data, more traffic. And the expectations in terms of latency reduction is 10x.\", \"So this requires more innovation, more collaboration, more broad market participation. And we're beginning those efforts now today built on a foundation with our technologies for 4G and LTE, built on the foundation that NFV and SDN gives us, and are partnering with industry leaders like SK Telecom, who is building out infrastructure in fact with the Winter Games in mind. So in 2018 we see this compelling opportunity to demonstrate some of this new technology and capabilities. As well as with a market leader like Nokia that is building the solutions for these types of service providers, and we've announced strategic collaborations with both of these companies publicly. We have many more that are ongoing that haven't been announced.\", \"But that continued innovation and technology to address those latency requirements, those higher data rates, the massive antenna requirements that will mean small cells and in big cells that I spoke about earlier, the investments that we've made as foundations in terms of some of the acquisitions that we've done, with the LSI Axxia assets to address that macro base station capability or the small cell assets that we acquired with the Mindspeed acquisition, all of that helps to build out the capability to address these heterogeneous networks going forward, this combination of 4G and 5G technology, and really accelerates the path to – our ability to address the 5G innovations.\", \"So just to wrap, the network infrastructure is undergoing a massive transformation, which is moving them from fixed-function purpose-built appliances to an approach that embraces general purpose processing, server virtualization, and cloud technologies. We have a tremendous growth opportunity at Intel because what is valued in that market inflection point in that transformation are all the areas where we have strong leadership. And we're investing and increasingly playing a role in terms of today's networks as well as the networks of tomorrow.

Because FPGAs, and Rob will go through this in much greater detail this afternoon, but they are excellent in terms of running algorithms that are either changing or variable, depending upon which part of the world you're in. Think about a security application that you may want to run differently in China versus Europe versus the U.S. You don't necessarily want to build out a whole different platform to service your customers in those different parts of the world.

The Data Plane Development Kit, the DPDK, just in the last five years alone that innovation has created a 25 times performance improvement in packet processing.

And so I'm making a bet, and I believe strongly that when we do this again four years from now, we're going to look back, and it's going to be one of those things where we thought the market was going to be this big, and then it was this big, and then it was this big. Similar to cloud, we keep raising the estimates on it because it surprises us. I think the same thing will be true of big data.\", 'So I want to talk a little bit about some of the underlying dynamics. What do we see as happening, how is the market evolving? And then of course, what does it mean to Intel from both a strategy perspective and how we might be driving our business?', \"So obviously, one of the big things that we hear when we talk about big data is the connection to all those devices. The IoT, as IoT becomes a reality, that's going to mean a tremendous amount of ingest, and that's then going to require us to store a tremendous amount of data. Sometimes I think about 35 zettabytes. I'm not really sure what that means. It's just so enormous. But hey, look, who am I to argue with industry statistics? I certainly haven't come up with a better estimate myself. But obviously, the idea of I've got all these devices streaming data, I've got all of this data that I've now stored, I need a means to go do something with it.\", \"And the three drivers of value when it comes to big data are really thinking about how do companies apply revenue growth. So a good example of this is all of the Internet ad placement or recommendation engines. They're all about taking big data and insights and turning it into revenue growth for them. It could be cost savings, so we deal with a lot of manufacturing companies that are looking to instrument their trucks, their factories, looking for ways to improve quality in the supply chain. One retailer is instrumenting their entire retail store so that they know exactly what's moving off the shelf, so they can constantly keep things going. That obviously would support both revenue growth and cost savings. And then the last piece is just looking for additional margin value.\", \"So what we're really doing here is figuring out how do take the value. Most of what has driven our Data Center business is taking information technology and making it more efficient. And so I tend to look at that as about a $0.5 trillion industry to a $1 trillion industry, and figuring out ways to make it more efficient, whether it's by more performance or making things easier to use.\", \"When you look at big data, the thing that I'm excited about and why it's such a giant opportunity is you're talking about multi-trillion dollar economic opportunities in government, in healthcare, in manufacturing, in basically the whole economy and figuring out how to make it more efficient, and then expanding it and turning that into an infotech opportunity. And so that's really the underlying dynamic.\", \"Then bringing it back to the more nuts-and-bolts stuff that we do, we've helped to really, I think, enable this revolution by driving two things. The first is the cost of a server has gone down over the past decade. Now the thing that this doesn't really show is that, yes, it came down by about 40%, and that's pretty impressive, but over the course of that decade, there's a 25-times performance improvement that was driven out of that 40% lower-cost server. So the economics of compute have dramatically shifted.\", 'And when you think back even just a decade ago, data management, data warehouses, they were done by pretty expensive monolithic systems. And now companies are ganging together to these more scale-out commodity types of systems, driven by the economics. And then the cost of storage continues to come down. So those two things are the enablers that are going to then go continue to drive the growth in big data.', \"And what you see on the chart is the big data TAM. We've broken it out by hardware, software, and services. Now looking at the 2013 data for a second, just $13 billion. One of the things that might be striking is actually how big a portion of that TAM the hardware is. And that's actually very different than the traditional data management type of environment. A lot of traditional data warehouse solutions, very, very high value on the software, proprietary types of solutions, expensive systems, but not a lot of hardware as a percentage of the share of wallet. And we've done the calculations to show that actually comparing old traditional data management and analytics and insight compared to big data, we actually see a 2x share of wallet coming to Intel. So for every bit essentially that moves over or data that moves over, it's good for us in terms of how much money gets spent on silicon.\", \"And then, of course, the real prize is if we can take that $13 billion and essentially get it to the $41 billion that we're projecting out by 2018. And again, a very healthy portion of that is hardware because you're talking about open source software. It's scale-out. It's something that has a high value in terms of the amount of performance that's delivered to the type of insight.\", \"So the thing we should be thinking about is we should just be able to sit back at Intel and just, as this happens, just let the money rain down. It's just so easy. Any monkey could go do this, like myself. But there actually are some challenges to making this evolve, and that's really where this chart comes in, and we've done a lot of work with end users. So these are the people that are in the community that are doing data management, doing research and talking about what makes this so difficult.\", \"And it really comes down to two big things. The first thing is and this is the dirty little secret about big data, is no one actually knows what to do with it. They think they know what to do with it. They know they have to collect it because you have to have a big data strategy, of course. But when it comes to actually deriving the insight, it's a little harder to go do. And that's what the biggest bar up there is, is how do I know once I've got all this data, what I should go do with it? And we'll talk about how we address that.\", \"All the other bars, which are important, really do come down to complexity. It's hard to integrate. So I mentioned they're commodity systems, but stringing together these clusters of systems to go do analytics in real time with open source software and fabrics and doing it at scale, again, this is why it was originated by Google and companies like Yahoo!, but it really still hasn't hit the mainstream masses. And having talent that can both understand what information you're looking for and set up the computer science problem and do this all together is pretty rare.\", {'mark': {'@type': 'ph'}, '#text': \"And so the implication for us on  the enhanced side (01:55:42) is there are a couple things we have to overcome when we look at big data. First is just the technology challenges of accelerating the TAM. We've got to help with use cases. So when we go find a retailer that knows how to find better insights and how to go take their in-store experience and combine it with the online experience to go sell more revenue, we want to help more people replicate that, so broaden the use cases.\"}, \"We have to make it easier to deploy, and again, I'll talk about it in a little bit. How can we go find a way, instead of having people piece together all these things and write a bunch of programs and stitch together big computers, make it easier to go deploy.\", \"There also, by the way, are some risks to Intel, and I want to make sure that you realize that we recognize them and we want to be able to address them. One of the big risks is the focus on proprietary solutions. Because this is difficult, the more that these become proprietary solutions, it either stalls the market because proprietary solutions tend to be more expensive, or they become an easier way of swapping out say non-Intel silicon with something more proprietary. And in particular, as we look toward machine learning, applications such as image recognition, as an example, these are becoming beachheads where both NVIDIA and IBM see it as an emerging workload, similar to like we do, but want to go ahead and make sure that they're using an opportunity to deliver tools and to deliver silicon that should be able to increase their footprint into the data center. So again, these are things that we'll talk about in a little bit, but these are the challenges that we're looking to overcome.\", \"And by the way, just one thing in case you didn't get this from the cloud portion, I like to end a little early and leave plenty of time for questions, so please do write down anything that you have in the way of questions.\", \"These are the four theses essentially to the Big Data strategy for Intel. The first one, and I start at the bottom, is really about the infrastructure. We need to make sure that as these new categories of applications emerge, whether they're machine learning, stream processing, Spark frameworks, Hadoop, it doesn't really matter. There are all these new open source frameworks. There's Flink, anyone heard of Flink? There's a new one every day. We need to make sure that we're engaged in that community and we're tuning the software and that it's optimized to run best on Intel architecture. And that means everything from the lowest end CPUs to things like Xeon Phi, but of course, our 3D XPoint technology, use of fabrics. This is a great – as Raj mentioned earlier, this is a great opportunity to pull through High Performance Computing infrastructure.\", \"The second element is around the data platform. And you can think of the data platform as just where am I storing and how am I managing all of this data. And there's actually two ways that you can do Analytics on these platforms. There is the distributed data storage platform, things like Hadoop and Spark also emerging as a very popular framework. And those are many, many systems where you're distributing the data across those systems. But there also are popular in-memory solutions, think of SAP HANA. And so again, we want to make sure that both a high-end, high-performance solution like SAP HANA, as well as a commodity, mass, big data scale-out type of solution such as Hadoop are optimized for Intel architecture. And we work with our own software engineers to go make that happen. We work with a number of different partners, like I mentioned SAP.\", \"But I think one of the biggest bets that you've seen us make is actually the investment in Cloudera. And I think it was pretty bold and I think a bit of a departure from us. We tend, on the whole, to do things very horizontally and to invest in many different spaces. We, in this particular case, saw that big data was going to be going through an inflection, and we needed a partner with us to help ensure that they could be both ubiquitous and drive an optimized Intel architecture roadmap. And so we have a roadmap with Cloudera that gives them security features that's already going to support 3D XPoint memory technology, that's working on optimization for things such as Xeon Phi. And so we go and make sure that goes happen at the data layer.\", \"Now that really isn't enough because as I mentioned earlier, part of the challenge is making sure that there are actual solutions. And just putting all of your data into a distributed data store doesn't exactly solve that problem, you need analytics on top of that.\", \"The analytics space is a giant jigsaw puzzle right now. If you look in the machine learning segment, there are over 200 different companies that focus in on different types of machine learning algorithms, very, very highly fragmented. And by the way, all of them tend to be proprietary. They're not open source. There isn't a broadly available framework.\", \"And so one of the things that I'll talk about in just a second is we need to invest in enabling a platform to make this easier because again if I want to see Walmart advancing their big data strategy – they certainly have, by the way, some tremendous data scientists. But it's still a lot of work and you're still limiting the applicability of big data to the people that really know how to go stitch together right applications, stitch together programming, layer it on top of big data. It just shouldn't have to be this hard. And some of you, like me, remember back in the college days, where to go write and run a regression analysis or do a Monte Carlo simulation that you actually had to go write a program in SAS to actually do it. And then along came Excel and voilà! Drag and drop and you can go do the stuff. We need that equivalent for big data.\", \"And one of the other things that we're doing in addition to trying to create something that's more of a platform is we need to go drive vertical use cases. So even though Intel has absolutely zero desire to go be an IBM global services or a professional services organization – when I say zero, it might be even less than zero desire, negative desire to go do this. We are engaged in a number of these different types of engagements because it helps to inform what we need to develop as a platform. And then the other piece of it is it allows us to help replicate those use cases and grow the overall industry. And so if we're successful, and I'll tie this back together at the end, we've got a great silicon opportunity. We accelerate that overall $41 billion TAM, and we go work with our partners to make that happen.\", \"So another major move that we've made recently is the open sourcing of a platform that we call Discovery Peak. And Discovery Peak is what we believe to be the first industry's open source analytics platform to really bring together multiple different layers. And the graphic – sorry, the graphic down below was to try and highlight that there are multiple different types of clouds. It actually is running, as an example, on OpenStack. It also is running on Amazon.\", 'So the idea also is that you can create an analytics platform that can run across multiple different clouds. And part of the philosophy that we have is whereas a lot of platforms are trying to aggregate and bring all of the data together, we believe that what actual companies want to do is they want to hold on to their data. They want to do their analytics. But they may actually want to go share data or share analytics across multiple different sites.', \"And so as an example, we're working on a healthcare solution with some partners up in Oregon that will allow you to do genomic cancer analysis using the Discovery Peak platform and do it across multiple different sites, where each research institution can hold on to their own genomic data and to keep that data confidential, but to be able to go share the analytics. Again, that's one of the things that makes this platform a bit different.\", \"You can see the different layers. You've got the orchestration services, which essentially allows somebody to deploy this more easily, so it's building off of the cloud-based infrastructure that we've talked about. It uses the data platform, and we are obviously heavily leveraging Cloudera in that layer. And then on top of it, we produced a number of different services. Some of them we've actually created with Inside Intel to go do things like graph analytics, but also working with a number of different partners on visualization solutions, on ingest, stream processing, and a host of other types of applications.\", \"And then on top of it at the applications layer, we've made it extensible, the idea being instead of having a data scientist trying to stitch all these pieces together, they can leverage the platform. They can write their own analytics and code and actually publish it, almost like an app store, within their own environment. And so this is really trying to take 90% of the non-value-added work out and allow the data scientist to go get that work done.\", \"The way this can be applied is in a number of different areas. And as I mentioned, we're working on different vertical use cases. Some of these are based off of wearables. We have companies in the wearable space that would like to understand how users or their customers are using some of that stuff. But also in some cases it can applied to healthcare. We're doing work with the Michael J. Fox Foundation on how wearables can be used in the home to track the progression of Parkinson's disease. We see opportunity in energy in optimizing the overall energy grid. I mentioned some of the cancer research that we are doing. So all of these are very interesting use cases. And our goal is to create a solution that we see a big market for, and then be able to turn it over to a range of different partners to go ahead and grow the overall footprint.\", \"So last slide, what does this really mean to Intel when you think about Intel as an investment? What's the opportunity? I think the first thing is that we are optimizing all of these frameworks. We want to make sure as this build happens, it's done best on Intel architecture. And I mentioned that's the full portfolio of our opportunity. We see that by 2020 there's about $2 billion to $4 billion worth of silicon opportunity in Big Data, and obviously we want to get the lion's share of that.\", \"The second thing is machine learning is within big data. If big data wasn't buzzy enough, machine learning is the buzzy part of big data, and this is something that we see as a competitive opportunity. I want to be clear about it, and we are going to win. We're tracking about 20 different types of machine learning algorithms. We're looking at how some of those things could be accelerated through an FPGA, again, looking for synergy in our product line or in our portfolio, but we want to make sure that we win on Intel architecture.\", \"We also want to make sure that the market grows, and there are two pieces to that. One is really building off and leveraging the Cloudera investment. They're a great partner. They're very capable. They are growing substantially. And we want to continue to build off of that momentum, particularly as it's optimized for Intel architecture.\", \"And then last is those use cases in the Discovery Peak platform. They're all about taking that $41 billion TAM and bringing it in. And already we've seen some of the analyst expectations for how big the market is starting to accelerate. Again, that's my prediction is that we'll continue to see the opportunity in big data be elevated over time, especially as we make these use cases a reality.\", 'So with that, any questions? Yes.']}}]}, {'@name': 'Q&A', 'speaker': [{'@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'Can you hear me?'}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Yes.'}}, {'@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': [\"I just need to touch the button. I guess two questions, the first one in terms of the market size. So maybe I'm conflating things here. So when Altera was thinking about the accelerator market and they were thinking it was going to be $1 billion by 2020, is that part of this silicon opportunity you're thinking about there?\", 'And then secondly, in terms of thinking about machine learning and big data, how much do you see today of the spending and the attention really more in the research or workstation area? And then how much, where are we in terms of deployment, and actually then saying wow, we need to have low latency, we need to have this working in a scale-out deployment, and so really used in the data center?']}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"So I'll answer both questions. Yes, there's a portion in the $2 billion to $4 billion that would be essentially allocated as opportunity in FPGA. It's not a huge portion of it but it is a portion, so it's included. But it's not the full $1 billion. That $1 billion opportunity is I'd call it intersecting circles, and that's where that intersection would be included in there.\", \"The second thing is, to your point about the analytics and how much on the workstations, so a lot of data science today in terms of setting up some of the models, people are using workstations to take a subset of the data and then essentially build their model on a workstation. But what I can tell you is that our estimate for the overall how big is big data right now in terms of real deployment, it's hundreds to thousands of CPUs in the data center right now, so it's very sizeable now. The machine learning portion of it is substantially smaller and it's really still nascent, but we are seeing that accelerate as well. Again, companies like Microsoft, Baidu, and others are really starting to gear up their investment, and it will help drive our business.\"]}}, {'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Joe?'}}, {'@id': '12', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the implementation of big data and the impact it might have on corporations deciding public versus private cloud. I.e., if data starts to become extremely valuable, could this reverse the trend towards public cloud? How are those conversions going presently with CIOs and CFOs?'}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"That's a great question, and I have to say it's very fragmented. It's hard to tell. There are some use cases where because it's I just want to get something going fast, they'll do it, for example, in Amazon EMR [Elastic MapReduce]. So you certainly see some cases where people want a platform. And because this is difficult to go do, they'll take the easy button, and the easy button will be, HDInsight from Microsoft or EMR at Amazon.\", \"But I definitely am hearing an undercurrent that more companies need and want their own platform. When we announced the open sourcing of Discovery Peak, which was literally just last week, we've been inundated. I was actually just talking to my product line manager about that yesterday, and he goes this is the worst day for me ever. You have no idea the flood gate that we unleashed because there is this latent need that people do want to keep their own data because that is a key value to their business, but they don't necessarily feel like they have the tools to go manage it, analyze it, and do that.\", \"So I do think if we can drive the right solutions, I think it will – I always think it will be a happy medium. I never try and be so black and white and binary. But I do think it will have – people have their own data. They'll be able to do their own analytics, but they'll be able to go federate with the cloud and, by the way, federate with other people's analytics as well, and that's part of the goal. There's another question over here.\"]}}, {'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Ross?'}}, {'@id': '13', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'Same sort of thing as far as the value of the proprietary data. How do you balance the competitive threat with people coming in with more proprietary solutions if whatever the customer is that has the data wants to analyze it in his or her own way? Is the adoption of something from an NVIDIA or an IBM that you mentioned more likely versus a standardized solution being adopted because of the nature of the market, at least in the initial stages of big data?'}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"That's a good question. I think there are two things that you're talking about, which is the proprietary and then what does it mean in terms of the silicon piece. I think in general, because people want to own their own data, I think that's the last bastion of proprietary. And it's hard to say I'm just going to give away and open source my own data; you don't have much of a company left at that point. So I think that tenet to me makes sense; own your own data, but then use horizontal open source standards based everything else. And that's why there's I think a desire for an open standards-based platform.\", \"And in fact, there was a financial services company that came to me and said hey, we were approached by Watson, by IBM Watson. And it's a very interesting platform in some respects, but candidly I just don't want a proprietary platform, and to some degree they're also competing with me on the data science side. So I think there are a lot of data points that we can highlight that say that companies want open platforms.\", \"Now open platforms in general I think should favor us quite well. It's because we've got a good history of knowing how to enable open source. We drive standards quite well. And by the way, because it's open, we've got what I call ninjas. We've got these ninjas that just know how to code and tune the heck out of everything as we get those ninjas in there, and they make things fly on Intel architecture.\", \"So for us, I think it tends to be a better competitive environment than something that winds up being a proprietary solution, which to your point you could attach something else. It doesn't mean that somebody would choose to do that over Intel architecture, but I think open always tends to favor our strategy in general.\"]}}, {'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Thanks, Jason.'}}, {'@id': '10', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Okay.

I'd be lost without that, excellent. Hi, I'm pretty excited to be talking to you today about our Silicon Photonics update. I'm Alexis Bjorlin, and I'm the General Manager of our Silicon Photonics Solutions Group here in the Data Center Group. I'm responsible to click, okay, all right.\", \"As we've heard from Jason, Sandra, and Raj already, there's a lot of innovation happening in the data centers today. What's needed by data center operators are a combination of high-performance compute, fast storage, and what I'm here to talk about is unconstrained connectivity. Now most of you went on the data center tour of Intel's data center earlier, and you can start to get a feel for what the connectivity requirements are in the data centers.\", \"There are three topics we're going to talk about today. Number one is the transformation in the data center. What you've heard about earlier is Intel's status in our transformation. But what I'm going to focus in on is the innovation happening by the cloud service providers that are enabling mega-scale or hyperscale data centers of today and of the future. So building on that innovation, it requires additional innovation. And what we have done here at Intel Silicon Photonics is a key enabler to continue that innovation and to enable mega data centers in the future. Finally, we'll focus in on what most of you are here today to hear about, which is the business opportunity this represents for both Intel and for the Data Center Group as far as non-CPU growth.\", \"So what do we mean by the data centers transforming? This is a picture here of a Facebook data center in North Carolina. This data center was initially put in place in 2012, and it's 370,000 square feet for just the first building. That's 10 times the scale of what you saw in our data center, in our larger data center just earlier today. But that wasn't big enough. In 2014 they added the second building, which makes this 750,000 square foot or just north of a 750,000 square foot data center.\", \"Inside one of these data centers, as you guys can imagine, and I'd like you to just visualize it, it's just rows upon rows of racks of servers and storage, all interconnected. In fact, over 100,000 servers, and it's estimated 60,000 in each building. So 120,000 servers are in this data center alone. The first data center when it was put down was 60 megawatts of power. So we can assume that this is – hopefully, they've gotten better efficiency and it's less than 120 megawatts, but we're talking huge amounts of power, huge amounts of network infrastructure. Apple and Google also have data centers in North Carolina. That's one of many areas. Mega-scale data centers are being deployed across the globe.\", \"When you think about the amount of bandwidth that's being processed here at the O&S just in June, Google stated a really resounding fact, which is the amount of data transversing one of these mega data centers exceeds that of the entire global Internet. As you could imagine, traditional approaches are reaching their limits. The network can no longer be the bottleneck and connectivity can't be a bottleneck. Innovation is required to cross all vectors and the entire ecosystem required to enable mega data centers.\", \"So we're going to talk about three pillars of this transformation, bandwidth scale, physical scale, and the traffic pattern shifts that are happening inside the data centers today. So the bandwidth scale, we all know there's been unprecedented growth in bandwidth. Google also mentioned that over the past six years, they've seen a 50 times increase in the amount of data center handled by any one of their mega data centers. That means there has been an unprecedented amount of growth in the number of storage and connected servers, connected servers and storage to process this. In addition, the physical scale has become quite large. For the Prineville, Oregon data center, which is just a 300,000 square foot data center, 21 million feet of optical fiber are deployed inside a single data center. So what that requires is a huge transformation in the amount of infrastructure and innovation in the traditional technologies that have been used.\", \"Finally, we heard from Sandra today significantly about software-defined networking and network functional virtualization. So no longer are the architectures of data centers defined simply by the physical hardware, but they're beginning to be defined by software definition. So an ideal data center is one massive cluster of compute that can be dynamically provisioned to handle any workload.\", 'How do you achieve that? You achieve that by having an ideal, fully meshed, fully interconnected data center. So as opposed to the enterprise data centers of the past where you can just envision from maybe some of your former workplaces, back cabinets full of Cat 5 cable, these interconnected data centers are – this is an example of a Facebook data center network design, fully connected. Whereas 80% of the traffic used to be north-south into and out of a data center, inside of a mega data center or a cloud service provider data center, over three-quarters of the traffic is actually transversing the data center in an east-west fashion.', \"So I'm giving you all these facts so that you can start to envision what's happening in the data centers and why is connectivity becoming a bottleneck. A new era of faster, denser, and longer reach connectivity is required.\", \"So now we're going to talk about how silicon photonics is an enabler for next-generation data centers. First thing, I'm going to step back and say what is silicon photonics. I'm sure most of you know in this room. But for those of you who don't, and I've been surprised by the amount of knowledge that is in this room today, we all know what silicon is. Silicon is the medium through which all of the semiconductor industry has been processed over the past 45 years. Silicon is the base platform for all of Intel's products.\", 'Photonics is the addition of light and light-emitting elements to that platform. You could think of it as an extension of the silicon platform. If you step back and think about photonics and where fiber optics has been used, fiber optics has been used since the beginning of time to communicate over long distances.', 'You could think about smokestacks on the tops of hills, where people were sending light. You could think about lighthouses even before fiber optics existed. In the 1960s the semiconductor laser was invented at Bell Labs. And from that, the entire fiber optics industry sprang up. So we all know that undersea cables and the network backbone of the United States or crossing the globe is based on long-distance fiber-optic transmission. So silicon photonics brings together two very unique industries, which is the high-volume, high-speed, high-performance silicon semiconductor manufacturing industry and that which enables long-distance data transmission.', \"So what does a silicon photonics module look like? Within a module, there are many elements. Silicon cannot emit light. So what we've had to do is find a way, and we've been at the forefront of innovation of silicon photonics for the past 10 years, find a way of combining this light-emitting material with silicon. We do that and utilize all the other elements that are used to combine and to create an optical transceiver.\", 'So the optical modules are at the ends of a connectivity link. They take the electrical data transmitted into optical. And then at the end of the fiber optic link, it gets reconverted back to electrical.', \"This is an example of one of our first products here. This is a very highly dense, compact 400 gigabit per second transceiver based on silicon photonics. But it's not just based on the silicon photonics alone. It's based on the entire manufacturing capability that Intel has, which includes all of the processing as well as the packaging. So inside this 400-gigabit transceiver, which is just a little bit larger than a quarter, we've got 16 channels of 25 gigabit per second transmitters and 16 channels of 25 gigabit per second receivers.\", \"So we've talked a little bit now about silicon photonics so you can understand its place. It's a high-density optical platform based on silicon, and it's used to enable network architectures that prior cannot be conceived.\", \"So now we'll step back and we'll look. What does the data center network look like? This is one. You've just toured one. But a typical mega data center network is comprised of rows and rows of racks of servers that are connected through a top-of-rack switch through a layer of aggregation switches, up to a core switch that then communicates out to the wide area network, or the WAN. All of what I'm showing here is inside of a single data center building. Inside a single data center, as we said, there could be over hundreds of thousands of servers, tens of thousands of switching elements, and over 0.25 million optical links.\", \"So what we've also said is that one of the most important things is the reconfigurability of the network to establish a virtual compute resource that we maximize the utility and maximize the efficiency of. In order to do that, you need to transmit data across the data center, so there's a lot of communication between one server and another. What does it look like today in today's network when this happens? You can follow the build here. So the example I've got is if this server on one side of the data center needs to communicate with another server that could be connected by two kilometers of fiber away, it can transverse over seven switching elements and takes quite a lot of time. The switching elements, there's congestion and there's latency associated with each switch. The data centers of today have been designed and developed based on the interconnect technology that's available that achieves the lowest total cost of ownership.\", \"What does the data center look like with the advent of silicon photonics, a high volume, low-cost, long-reach connectivity that is made for the scale of these mega data centers. What you can do is you can envision – and there are many network architectures out there, this is just one. But the idea is to enable that innovation to continue. What I'm showing here is that when these two servers need to communicate, they need to go – you can envision each top-of-rack switch connected across the data center, utilizing the long lengths to create a fully meshed architecture. So at the top of each rack you're interconnected and can communicate with any one of the aggregation layer switches. What that enables is the communication across the data center to happen in a shorter amount of time with less latency, effectively reducing some of the switching elements that are required and reducing the total cost of ownership.\", 'So how are technology choices made in the data center? There are a lot of technologies to choose from. And the technology choices are generally based on total cost of ownership, so power consumption, number of networking elements required, the cost of the optical transceivers.', \"So I'm going to go over what the data center connectivity landscape looks like and the choices that exist. The choices that exist are a function of reach and a function of the data rate. So as you can imagine, the I/O is becoming the bottleneck, the input/output feeds, how fast and how fat of a pipe we can make to interconnect our servers with the switching elements and interconnect our network as a whole.\", \"So I'm going to talk to you about two different elements here. This is at 25 gigabits per second. We have many different distance requirements across a data center. So hyperscale data centers require up to two kilometers of reach. We've got the in-rack or typically three-meter connections. We've got connections across the rows, which are between 10 meters and 100 meters. And then we've got connections that are across data centers, which can be anywhere between 100 meters and two kilometers. And then we've got the interconnection in between data centers, which is the inter-data center connections.\", \"So in-rack, the choice today is copper. It's the lowest total cost of ownership, the lowest power, and the lowest overall cost. Across the rows, there's a choice between traditional short-reach optics that are called VCSELs, or silicon photonics can also achieve those distances. When you reach across the data center links, you need a single-mode infrastructure. That simply means you need long-reach transmission optics.\", 'Silicon photonics is best positioned to satisfy that. Although it could also be satisfied with traditional long-reach optics, remember the choice is about total cost of ownership, and the traditional long-reach optics use a huge amount of manufacturing and do not have the cost structure to truly enter the data center at this scale. This is a breakthrough technology, silicon photonics that enables future-proofing of data center networks.', 'So what happens as we increase the speed? At 50 gigabits per second, what we see is the advantage that silicon photonics has continues to grow. Traditional technologies, copper can no longer transmit as far. As you increase the modulation speed, the distance goes down. Short-reach VCSELs can only transmit across 50 meters. And as we achieve 100 gigabit per second line rates, which we anticipate in the next few years and has already been ratified by the IEEE standards, silicon photonics actually becomes the technology of choice for in-rack as well.', \"So we've gone over the technology choices that exist, and silicon photonics has a major value-add in the data center to enable not only new network architectures, but enables the lowest total cost of ownership.\", \"So we're going to talk about why Intel silicon photonics is going to capture this market or who is better positioned than Intel to capture the silicon photonics market. Remember, it's a platform based on semiconductor manufacturing.\", \"We've invested 10 years of R&D resources into silicon photonics platforms and technology. Through that innovation, we've been able to achieve and bring out a unique hybrid integrated laser, which is a simple yet beautiful way of combining light-emitting material onto the silicon platform. This is unique to Intel.\", 'One of the traditional hurdles to silicon photonics has been coupling light, which is created by a different material system, into the silicon platform at the 300-millimeter wafer scale. The way that we do it here at Intel is we put the material system down in the very beginning. We bond the material, and then we use our traditional manufacturing technologies to lithographically define the lasers and define the products that we have. So this is a huge advantage because it enables best-in-class scalability. When you can use lithography to define and create lasers in silicon, you can imagine creating very dense arrays of laser upon laser. We can also utilize the unique properties of light-emitting materials that you can emit light in different colors. So we have two vectors along which we can scale. We can see our both on arrays of densely packaged lasers. We can also scale with light, with WDM, Wavelength Division Multiplexing.', \"So whereas our innovation enables us to put the light onto the laser, ultimate silicon photonics technologies still are utilizing outsourced or an outside material system, creating lasers that then need to be actively coupled and with pick-and-place technology to couple into silicon benches. So it's more of a hybrid infrastructure, whereas we have the most fully complete integrated silicon photonics solution. With this, we're able to achieve the highest density and the reach required for mega data centers.\", \"So finally, we'll move on to the business opportunity this presents. So the data center connectivity TAM is pretty significant. We're at the dawn of a new era of connectivity and new data center architectures. What I'm showing here is the data center total spend on 100 gigabit per second and 400 gigabit per second aggregate links. 2016, with the advent of 25 gigabit per second line rates enabling 100 gigabit per second aggregate links is about a $1.2 billion market. In 2020, we're seeing over a 50% compound annual growth rate to a $5.1 billion market. The markets that we're addressing in 2020 are across the data center, across the row, and in-rack, which is a huge portion of the $5.1 billion market.\", \"So how are we driving the transformation? So Intel Silicon Photonics is first targeted at the switch-to-switch interconnects, enabling further innovation in the cloud. We're then going to be focused on our continued high-density, highest-density scalable arrays to continue to advance high-performance computing.\", \"And finally, what I'd like to leave you on is a thought about integration. This is an area where Intel has excelled, and it's a core pillar of Intel's approach. When we built silicon photonics on silicon with the highest degree of integration, it allows us to think about and conceive end-to-end network architectures that allow us to bring optics directly onto the CPU or onto switches, which is a very high-efficiency manner of combining the long-reach connectivity with the existing processing power of the silicon manufacturing engine.\", \"So in summary, we've got cloud service providers innovating across the data center. Silicon photonics and specifically Intel Silicon Photonics can enable this transformation by enabling the lowest total cost of ownership and conceiving unheard of or new network architectures. Finally, Intel Silicon photonics as such is an engine for data center growth.\", 'Thank you.']}}}, {'@name': 'Q&A', 'speaker': [{'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Blayne?'}}, {'@id': '4', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': \"Maybe if you just wrap some timing around this in terms of availability of products, what you've said before.

For in-rack today it's still copper. Copper achieves a better cost per bit. VCSELs and short-reach technology achieve – I would say it's a combination of cost and power for the very short-reach distances.

I am happy to be here. We're going to just do a little bit of background on where we're going with the business, and then obviously open up it for Q&A, and we'll hopefully have plenty of time for that.\", 'So I first want to – we are a data-based business, and the explosion of data and trying to turn that into information is driving our business. We are very focused on the data center. And as we look at turning that data into information, we see a tremendous opportunity to improve the latency and access to that data so that people can take advantage of it. You guys are familiar with the financial services side of this thing. Having very consistent and high-performance transactions is important. You need fast, low-latency access to data, and preferably in as small chunks as you can get it.', \"Fraud detection, big giant uses of information, but if it takes too long to find out, it's a lot less useful to detect the fraud. And of course, optimizing for healthcare and for advertising, the more we optimize, the more money we can make.\", \"And when we look at what that's doing, first in terms of NAND, so if we look at the first step in getting data closer to the data center or to the CPU in the data center, the first stage in that is driving NAND. And the NAND-based SSD market started its modern version of its evolution in 2008. And in aggregate, that market is over $14 billion right now, basically from zero to $14 billion in seven years. So it's growing very fast and is projected to grow fast as well.\", \"And this chart is showing the gigabyte version of that growth. So the use of data in data centers is growing at an exponential rate. And it's growing in a way that is embracing the legacy interfaces to storage, things like SAS and SATA. Or the blue is SATA, which is a traditional hard disk-based interface; and SAS, which is another traditional hard disk-based interface. And those have been the primary drivers for the early portion of the market growth because you've got to plug into the hole in the box that exists if you're a new technology. But you really want to re-optimize for that, and you want lower latency, the thing that's more optimized for silicon-based storage, and PCIe is that interface, and you could see how that's growing much, much faster and becoming a dominant portion on that.\", \"And so in our business, we continue to invest in SATA-based storage products, and then SAS together with HGST and our relationship with them, we do have a huge focus on PCIe because we see that as the right interface for storage and the fastest growing one as well. And why is that? That is because it's lower latency. And if you look here, this is the view of a storage access if you will, how long it takes to get the data from a hard disk. And what we've done is we've chopped off the hard disk bar there because if we do it to scale it would go through the roof of the building probably.\", \"And so when you move of course to much faster media like NAND, these legacy storage interfaces start to get to become a problem. And with the NVMe-based PCIe products, we get a significant reduction in latency and efficiency and utilization of a server. And it doesn't look that much shorter, but it has a significant impact actually on the performance of applications in the data center.\", 'So if you look at a vertical, a series of vertical applications, it has a multiplicative impact just to go from hard disks to SSD. So if you start with just a SATA-based SSD taking a Microsoft SQL example for doing big data analytics, you move from a hard disk to NAND-based SSDs. You see a doubling in your server efficiency. You see tremendous improvements in performance, like a 6x improvement in performance. And it drives higher utilization in the data center and better customer service for various applications.', 'Now if you then just take that and you change that to be a PCIe-based storage interface, it doubles yet again. So that improvement in latency is critically important to these transaction-based applications. So getting short latency, shorter latency access has a big improvement. You go from 2x to 4x the server efficiency, and we hope to drive more refresh with that kind of technology improvement as well as building a business alongside the CPU business. So improvements in application performance with NAND, and NAND is going to grow big, as we indicated before.', \"Now that's not the end of our story, of course. We want to go beyond NAND and we want to increase – reduce latencies even further. And we have come up with a new technology that is intended to work for both memory and storage, and it is a new innovation that we call 3D XPoint technology, and it is a new type of memory. So it's a new class of memory. It's not a simple extension of NAND or a simple change from DRAM. In fact, both at the physics level as well as at the memory attribute level, it's very different. And we can use it for both memory and storage, and I want to show you a little bit using that same graph, how that works.\", \"But just to give you the three-bullet takeaway, if you will, this new memory technology is a new class of non-volatile memory. It is going to be significantly faster than NAND media, and I'll show you what that feels like in just a moment. But it's up to 1,000 times faster than NAND. It is tremendously higher endurance. So that means you can use it like memory, much more so. But when you compare it to DRAM, it's much denser than DRAM.\", \"So our first product is 128-gigabit and today's memories are – DRAM is about 8 gigabit in density and the state-of-the-art NAND is about 256 gigabits, so not quite as dense as NAND, but tremendously denser than DRAM, yet non-volatile. And it stores its memory in terms of a material property change as opposed to electrons stored on either a floating gate or a capacitor. So physically it's very different, and then its attributes are very different.\", \"What I wanted to do was show you – I showed you a chart earlier. This fun graph here, we have the hard disks going through the ceiling. But if I now jump to the – you can imagine if I make this orange much shorter, it looks different, but I can't show you on the same chart. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this smallest bar on the chart and I'm going to move it over here and then cut it off because then it would go through the roof of the building if I'm not careful.\", \"So what you see here is – thank you, Diane. So this is the small bar now with a large delay. It looks like a super-long delay on the media based on NAND. And then we take this new media and we put it on there. And you can see why it was so important that we move to the new interface because even this new interface though is, as much as it's a huge improvement over NAND-based memory, really that interface is a problem, and what we want to do is move to something that's even lower latency.\", \"So we're going to build storage-based products because they are still way faster than NAND-based products, but we are also going to build DIMM-based products that will have even lower latency because we've eliminated, if you will, the interface and turned that into hardware and got rid of the software. And then we got rid of a fair amount of the controller complexity that slows the media interface down here as well. And so we think this will be a significant advantage to our enterprise platforms.\", \"So we get significantly lower access, about 10x lower access. Anyway, it's about 10x improvement in performance over NAND-based SSDs and then even obviously much, much greater when we get to a short interface path.\", \"And so we are going to build some DIMMs for Diane's platform to bring out with the next generation platform. They fit in the socket that is already there for DDR4. It requires our next-generation platform in order to take advantage of it because it needs to understand how the memory works. So it requires the next-generation platform.\", {'mark': {'@type': 'ph'}, '#text': \"It allows us to solve problems that haven't been able to be solved before. So we get tremendous increase in memory capacity. So if you have big data problems, 4x increase in memory is a lot. It's a 4x increase in the maximum size of the memory, so it has a significant impact on that. And it will work and look just like either storage or memory without OS modification. So it looks just like big, really big memory without an OS modification, or we have storage  drivers (2:48:02) that make it look like just wicked fast storage as well.\"}, \"So what does that mean? That has a significant impact on any applications that launch really big memory, so massive in-memory database applications, something that cares about resiliency because now you no longer if you have a big memory system, you're no longer reloading that memory if something goes wrong.\", \"You're just doing a consistency check on it, and you're off and running. And/or if you want very low-latency storage, so if you want transactional-based very fast storage, and of course high endurance for – think of it as a database log applications, that sort of thing. And we're excited about what people are going to event on top of this that we haven't been working on. But we have been obviously working with leading ISPs in the industry to try and make sure that they're ready – the things that you would expect us to be working on, database applications, that sort of thing. Whether it's for client-based applications or we think a huge, obviously huge opportunity for this is in the data center.\", \"One of our favorite topics is genomics, and it's a big data problem in terms of actually rapidly and cost-effectively doing the genomic work, but also then mining large databases of healthcare to provide personalized medicine to folks. So we hope that this will be a breakthrough in that area as well, but many, many more applications to come.\", \"And then I would just say we're really excited about both the NAND-based business, which is doing quite well in the data center, both on the existing legacy interfaces as well as what's happening with NVMe. It's a transition happening in the marketplace that enables us to maintain and differentiate our product lines, and then migrating to 3D XPoint on PCIe and NVMe as well as on the DIMM interface.\", 'So with that, I would be happy to take any questions.

You do things with the controller technology that even though you're using commodity NAND, you're adding a lot more value than just to be pure medium.

So we think there's still plenty of room in just pure technology driving.\", \"But over and above that, I agree that one of the things that I think is one of Intel's core assets in driving these storage products into the data center is our deep understanding of computer architecture, where it's going, what the bottlenecks are, how to solve them in both software and hardware, places where we can provide acceleration, places where we just need to bridge things around reliability and that sort of thing.

All right, so I'm the other Rob, Rob Haze. I run strategic planning in the Data Center Group. So I own the product roadmap for all the Data Center business.\", \"And I'm going to talk about accelerators and accelerators demystified. So we're just going to really talk about what are accelerators. What are the different implementations in the industry that people might have used to deploy an accelerators? What are the workload requirements and what kind of workloads are people using accelerators for today? And then finally, I'll finish with what's Intel's approach to accelerators. How do we support them on the platform, as well as I'll give you a little bit of a sneak peek into how people are using FPGAs to deploy different kinds of accelerators in a very flexible manner, which might hint to some future opportunities.\", \"So I thought maybe I would just start with what is an accelerator. I think it could have many meanings, but what I'm talking about specifically today is hardware assists that can improve the performance for very specific workloads beyond what you could get on a general purpose processor alone. And we know that general purpose processors are really the most flexible thing you can deploy. They support pretty much any application. They can be programmed pretty much by anybody with the right skills. And they're always the lowest total cost of ownership thing that you could possibly deploy just based on the standard high-volume economics of standardizing on a single configuration and deploying it at scale, and you saw a lot of that in the data center tour today.\", \"So why would a customer choose an accelerator to add to the platform? It's really because they're looking for better performance. They're looking at the workload, and they look at the peak workload or the peak load of a given workload. And they see some opportunity to get substantially better performance per TCO over the total cost of ownership than they could get using just general purpose processors alone at scale. And I'm not talking – it's much greater. It's not 20%. If it was 20%, they'd probably just buy the next SKU of the CPU or wait until next month when we launch a better one. We're talking 2x, 3x, 4x, where they see really substantial multiple benefits to accelerate their workload without too much cost added to the platform, which is also a key ingredient or a key part of the equation.\", \"Generally, they're not offloading an entire workload. They're looking at the overall application that they're running, and they're trying to figure out what's the specific portion of the code that is running some kind of routine stable algorithm or calculation that might be accelerated in some specific or purpose-built piece of hardware. And the rest of the application will continue to run on the general purpose processor, and that specific portion of the code would be offloaded to some fixed function or purpose-built accelerator logic.\", \"There are several different implementation options, and that's what I'll show you next, how people might go build these. First of all, let me orient you to my chart here, a simple 2x2. What we have on the left are standardized solutions. Think of these as you go buy something off the shelf, and it pretty much is what it is when you buy it. It may be programmable or it may not be programmable. It may be fixed function. On the right hand is a customized solution, meaning they may be programmable or not, but it's really something that's flexible for the end user of the OEM or a system provider that they can configure it to do something specific that they want to go do.\", \"Okay, so that's my world here, and I've populated it with the four typical implementations that you would see in the industry, and these are all hopefully familiar terms to you. So on the upper left we have processors or CPUs. And these are products that are available on the market. They're really designed to be a flexible ways to program through software anything you want based on just common math functions or logical operations, add, subtract, multiply, divide, inverse, and/or these kinds of just simple functions, and you can pretty much build any application out of those functions and stringing together different instructions.\", \"On the opposite end of the spectrum, on the lower right we have ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits. These are chips by definition built by their user. They are built using whatever proprietary IP they have. They may pull from an ecosystem of other IPs, but they configure a chip that's purpose-built and captive or proprietary for their own use.\", \"And then different than ASICs, we start to see even a growing market and a shift from ASIC towards what we call ASSPs, or application-specific standard products. And this is where vendors, Intel or others, look at what kind of functions are people doing in ASICs. Are there things that are common enough in the industry that there might actually be a market for selling a chip that does that function? So this could be like an Ethernet switch or a GPU or something like that where it's a pretty common usage and you can offer that product in the merchant market and anyone can use it. And that's an ASSP, pretty much fixed function really purpose-built.\", \"And then in the upper right hand we have FPGAs. Now FPGAs are similar to an ASIC in that you can customize it. You could pretty much build whatever you want out of it. But it's also similar to an ASSP or a processor in that it's a merchant product. You can go buy it. You don't have to build the silicon yourself. You buy the silicon and then you program it in the hardware. You program the hardware to do the function that you want.\", \"Those are the definitions. And if that's not clear, I thought I might use an analogy to talk about what it's similar to. So the ASIC, these have been around since the beginning of silicon time. This is where the world began, which is people use the silicon technology to build whatever they want. It's like a stone tablet. If you have the skills and the tools and the time, you can pretty much make it say whatever you want. But once you've written it, it's done. It's going to be the same, so it's pretty much etched in stone.\", \"You could also as an ASSP say hey, I could build a rubber stamp. I've got this operation. I'm going to do it over and over and over again, exactly the same operation. I could build a stamp, sell you a stamp, and you could just hammer through all of those different documents very quickly using something you bought at Staples.\", \"An FPGA is like a printing press. I can configure the typeset. I can have it say whatever I want, and then I can just print a bunch of books or a bunch of newspapers. I can go very rapidly. And tomorrow when I want to print the next newspaper, I can reconfigure it and I can print that one. So there's some setup time and some overhead in reconfiguring it. But it's reconfigurable, and you can get very high throughput once it's configured.\", \"And then the CPU is – I call it like the word processor, which is anybody can use it. You can do whatever you want with it. You can scale it with high-volume printers and things like that, but it takes a little bit of effort, but it's very flexible. Sandra was nice enough to point out you can also have your spreadsheet and your e-mail and your video and everything else on that too, so it's a very flexible solution. Hopefully, that's a little more clear now.\", \"Okay, why would you chose each of these? So a CPU would be chosen, it's really best for where you want that performance across a broad range of workloads. If you want to build an infrastructure, think a cloud infrastructure, a high-performance compute cluster, a telco communications infrastructure that's very flexible, and you want to be able to support all those workloads and the innovation and you want to do it at a very low total cost of ownership, that's what CPUs are best for.\", \"ASICs, on the other hand, are best for when you as a user or a system vendor have some proprietary value that you want to go implement and differentiate yourself. And it has enough value that it's worth the cost, the R&D cost, the manufacturing cost, and the time to go implement that in silicon.\", \"If you don't have that kind of time and skills, et cetera, or you don't see the value in your proprietary logic, then you would either buy an ASSP or you would buy an FPGA. And the difference there would be you would buy the ASSP if you wanted – you had very stable logic that you were trying to serve and you saw a merchant product that met that need. And the easiest and fastest thing to do is then go buy that purpose-built piece of silicon and deploy it, and so that would be best for that.\", \"And then an FPGA would be similar in lot of those regards. But if your workload isn't stable, in other words, it will change over time, and I don't necessarily mean over minutes or seconds, but I mean over maybe days, weeks, months, you might want to buy an FPGA instead because then you could have the opportunity to change the functions and the calculations that it's doing and/or you could put your proprietary logic into that just like you could in an ASIC, but you could do it much faster and cheaper from an R&D perspective than building your own piece of silicon. So I can just program something off the shelf, it's still proprietary and differentiated, and I could ship it. So that explains some of the different value props of each of these, and there is a market and a world where each of these exists.\", \"And then you think about discrete versus integrated. Most accelerators start as discrete. So I've drawn a picture here on the left. So this is a high-level server, if you will, and you've got a general purpose processor in it. And that processor, like it says, has general purpose execution units in it. And then you could put an accelerator off the host bus, which would typically be PC Express in a modern server. And in that accelerator, you would custom craft your function for whatever string of calculations or logical operations you want to run inside that accelerator. And a lot of the code and operating system things like that would run on the base CPU, and then it would offload the portions of the code over the accelerator to get the better performance, and they would work together in a coprocessor model.\", \"This is great for configuration and flexibility. If you're building a system, you can choose to put or not put the accelerator in there, choose different kinds of accelerators. It's good for time-to-market in that the CPU product cadence can be on one time schedule and the accelerator product cadence can be on a different time schedule. And you're not compromising the cost or any trade-offs in any one chip or the other. So that would be the benefit of discrete.\", \"On the other hand, a lot of accelerators get integrated. And integration provides basic benefits of improved performance because you don't have to go off-chip, slow down to go off-chip onto the next chip, improved energy efficiency because it's lower power to transmit data on-die than it is off-die. And you also minimize the system cost because there's benefits of just cost reduction through integration that we've realized for years.\", \"So we look at accelerators discrete or integrated, and over time, where we see scale of discrete accelerators that have enough scale in the market and opportunity, then we integrate them, and we've done that for years and we continue to do that.\", 'So then you start to think about okay, great, so what workloads might I accelerate? And we as a large player in the server market, of course, have to look at basically all the workloads, a very broad range of workloads, and really try to understand a few things. Number one is what is the market demand for those workloads or how many people are deploying those workloads and what are the growth rates, so we can understand where the market is going. We also need to understand what are the technical characteristics or attributes of those workloads and what opportunity might we have to make them run faster.', \"And so I've shown here a bunch of bubbles, and these all represent different classes of workloads, and it's not exhaustive. These are some of the common examples here. And you can see that we look at things that are I/O intensive, so how much data are they sending in and out of the chip? How many things are compute-intensive, that are CPU intensive, meaning how many calculations are they running, pattern matches, things like that? Or how many are memory intensive? In other words, they've got large sets of data that they're reading and writing and operating on. And you can see that there's a broad range of different combinations of sort of sensitivities of these, and that's really important to understand. If you're going to go accelerate something, you've got to know what you're going to accelerate and how you going to accelerate it.\", \"So we try to understand that. We look for the technical opportunity to accelerate either in the base CPU or in an accelerator. And then we also look again at which workloads are growing. And what I've shown here on the top are the three fastest growing classes of workloads that we just have to nail. These are the things where a lot of innovation is going on in the industry, and we need to make sure that they run best on IA and on our platform. And so these are some areas we're investing in both improvements to the CPU, improvements in the software ecosystem, and improvements – and actually, developing accelerators themselves. And I'll share some of those examples in a minute.\", \"And everything starts with just improving general purpose computing performance. And Diane showed this chart earlier today, but we're just on a constant march, built on Moore's Law, but turning a lot of different architectural knobs that we have in the platform to constantly improve the general purpose performance that we get out of the platform for that broad range of workloads.\", 'We target a few workloads with special instructions or optimized feature innovations to get a big pop on the general purpose CPU. But then beyond that, we look at additional things we might go do at the platform level to even further accelerate performance at those multiples level, 2x, 4x, and beyond.', \"So the first thing we do is we optimize software for IA. So we have a whole bunch of different libraries, math kernel libraries, data acceleration libraries, data plane development kits, storage acceleration libraries, a whole bunch of different developer tools and reference code where we've basically put our ninjas, as Jason called them, on the software problem and said, here's an algorithm, here's a common mathematical function, linear algebra, whatever. Go really make sure that thing screams on IA, taking advantage of the latest and greatest technologies that we have. And then we'll put those into the libraries. We'll release them out to our developer ecosystem and they can build on top of those building blocks and have confidence that they're going to get the best performance out of the platform they can before they've even added in any accelerators.\", \"After that, if we see opportunity to invest in discrete accelerators that could provide even better performance, again, for routine calculations, then we do it. And we've got a whole bunch of these that we've done forever and continue to do.\", \"Back in the day, we did floating-point coprocessors. Math coprocessors are now integrated. We've got GPUs that at one point back in time all used to be discrete. Now they're integrated in a broad portion of our portfolio in both the client and the server roadmap. Today, people are starting to experiment and deploy FPGAs on PCI Express as discrete next to our CPU. But over time, like I said, where the market opportunity hits enough scale and the cost of those deployments come down low enough, we'll integrate those into the CPU. And there's examples of this where we've integrated the graphics processor, like I said before, onto the CPU. We look at accelerating compression and other types of capabilities onto the CPU. And then we offer an even better solution where we've got integration.\", \"And then finally, we are constantly evolving the instruction set for Intel architecture. And when we see an opportunity to even further improve the performance or reduce the cost, we will do that. We will extend the instruction set, and we'll basically make that an autonomous instruction, reduce the clock set, reduce the cost, and so forth.\", \"And so I think of this as just a flow. Everything starts with making the software run as best as it can on the hardware you have, supplement with discrete, integrate and integrate further. And that's the flow, and we've done this many, many times for as long as I've worked here. So that's the playbook, and we continue to execute it.\", \"I heard that you guys might be interested in FPGAs, and so what I wanted to do is just spend a little bit of time talking about three of the big use cases that we see. And I think these are really the primary use cases that we see. It's not exhaustive. There's others, but these are the three that we hear most from our customers right now.\", \"And so let me talk about the yellow line on the top here real quick. So this is in a generic sense how you would use FPGA, and then we'll talk about the specific use cases in a second. So you can use an FPGA if you had one application that would span across many servers, and you're able to find that chunk of code that you could custom craft that function and offload it to the FPGA, and that's one use case. And when we get to the cloud service providers image recognition, that's one example there.\", \"You could implement customer-specific solutions. If I have a custom way of doing some packet processing or something or security algorithm or something, I can implement it in an FPGA. And then if I have an algorithm that I need to change over time, I have an opportunity to reprogram it and still get the same kind of performance that I wanted out of that accelerator on the FPGA, but it doesn't have to be static over time, so I can still get more utilization out of that infrastructure.\", \"So three examples of customers here, I've got a cloud service provider example, an OEMs system vendor example, and a comm service provider example. What we're seeing, and Jason alluded to this earlier, in the public cloud is one of the, I would say, primary competitive fronts in public cloud service providers in the search arena is being able to search images and videos and things like that and find people without people having to tag who they are and find other objects. There's other applications for image recognition in cars and robots and other things that technology can also be used for. But in the public cloud, think of it as image search as the use case I'm talking about.\", 'And one of the technologies that has been really moved out of academia over the last decade or so and moved into deployment is deep learning and convolutional neural networks specifically. And this is a technique that people are using to be able to rapidly have the machine learn and recognize different images and tag people and find people very quickly.', \"And what they're finding is that they have two parts of this use case. One is they train. So they have a small cluster on the side that's a very high-performance HPC-like cluster, and it trains itself to recognize these images and detect who the identification is or what the object is and things like that. And once that training phase is done, you've got an algorithm and you want to go deploy that algorithm in production across whatever, the 100,000 servers that were in the data center that Alexis showed you today, and you want to able to just run that algorithm as fast as possible. And so what we see is that FPGAs are used in that deployment, could be used in that deployment phase, and that's where some of the experimentation is going on right now.\", \"And so you get an algorithm. Your training cluster says this is it. This is the best way do image search, and then you deploy it. And today that's all deployed on just typical Xeon servers in most data centers, but it could be accelerated by programming in that function into the FPGA.\", \"I'll say one thing because there was a question earlier this morning on this that's relevant to the topic here, which someone said GPU and FPGA in the same sentence, and I think these are like apples and oranges. Today, GPGPUs are used in high-performance computing. And we have our Xeon Phi solution, which we think is a great solution, comparative on performance with what people can do with GPGPUs, but a better developer experience that's more consistent with IA. That's all a competitive front that's happening in the training phase, in these high-performance compute clusters where they're trying to learn the algorithm and all that.\", \"When we talk about FPGA accelerators, we're really talking about that scale, production, we'll call it scoring phase where you've got the algorithm and you want to go deploy it. And so they're really not apples to apples. So I thought I'd add that right here.\", \"Let's see, so the next one is security appliance vendors. And so you can imagine that you're building a firewall, a gateway, some way to encrypt data between data centers, maybe between countries or within your country. And you're going to want to – you're selling this appliance in there and you have a unique way of encrypting that data or protecting it or doing identity management and things like that. FPGAs are a good way of programming that in. You're getting lots of packets coming off the network at a very high velocity. And you can deploy that algorithm and it can operate very quickly using an FPGA – using encryption. And you may want to change that algorithm over time, by the way, because you have a better encryption algorithm next week than you had this week, so you may want an FPGA to be able to reprogram that.\", \"And then the next one is the comm service provider, so a similar use case in that network equipment is one of the largest places where FPGAs are deployed today. We see just a lot of high-velocity throughput traffic. There are a lot of routine calculations, packet parsing, pattern matching, whitelisting, things like that that are going on. And in FPGA, you can program in your specific way of doing that, and an FPGA can help supplement some of the application processing and things that are happening on the general purpose CPU with network function virtualization. So it's a good offload mode, similar to fixed-function accelerators that we offer like compression and encryption and some of our QuickAssist technology, so different ways of implementing a similar use case.\", \"So the last thing I'll say here is we've announced publicly previously that we're going to integrating FPGAs on package with Xeon. And so we haven't announced when that product is coming out, but it's coming out in the near future. And so we see an opportunity not just to embrace FPGAs on the platform as discrete, but to integrate and drive that value proposition I talked about before with lower power, lower cost, higher performance. And so when the Altera acquisition closes, then we have opportunities to start to execute on that. So we're very excited about that opportunity, and these are some of the initial areas where we're getting a lot of customer interest in really being able to optimize those products to work best together.\", \"So in summary, really accelerators apply best or really only in scale is when they're providing a substantial performance benefit over general purpose processing and a substantial performance benefit at the lowest total cost of ownership, so you have to have both of those things to be true at scale. People implement these in ASSP merchant market format. They implement them as an ASIC as a proprietary I own it thing, and they implement them in FPGAs, and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses relative to each other.\", 'Our approach is make sure general purpose computing continues to march forward in delivering better and better performance. That benefits everybody, optimizes software to run best on it, offer discrete in the select areas where we see an opportunity to do so, integrate and deliver better performance, power, and cost benefits in doing so.', \"So with that, I would like to thank you and I'll answer any questions you have.\"]}}}, {'@name': 'Q&A', 'speaker': [{'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'Blayne?'}}, {'@id': '4', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': ['Thanks, Rob, for the presentation, two questions. What do you need to do on the software, the OS side, to make the system aware that you have FPGA acceleration rather than doing it in software on the CPU?', \"And then a second question, the trend towards network function virtualization seems to perhaps work against an FPGA implementation in that if you want a flexible industry-standard server that can run different workloads, you're going to have an FPGA that has a fixed function program that sounds like it works against the trend towards network function virtualizations. So how do you see FPGA acceleration playing out in that comm service provider segment?\"]}}, {'@id': '16', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"Okay, so the first question about what do we need at the operating system level to be able take advantage of an FPGA, today FPGA is – they're deployed in one of two models. Either they're deployed in some other platform that not an Intel standard server, and I won't answer that question. But when you put it into an Intel architecture server, it's a PC Express device today, so it operates just like any other PC Express device. The FPGA vendor, Xilinx, Altera, whoever it is, would need to provide a driver that would work with Windows or Linux or something like that. And then that would begin an I/O model. So the application would need to know that hey, I'm going to send or receive data off to this FPGA, and the FPGA would be programmed to do whatever operation it does once it receives that data.\", \"And then when it's integrated in the package, we are working on the software solution, but it's basically we're integrating on the memory interface, the coherent interface in a solution that we have right now. And so we're working on both the software and the hardware modifications that would need to be made in the platform and in the operating system. We make that just work seamlessly. And then moving forward, our focus is really less on the system level software, but more on the application developer environment and how we make that a really good experience and really easy to deploy, so that you don't have to have people that are like RTL hardware engineers going off and programming these FPGAs, which is what it's been up until now. And it's more like any software developer can write a software application for x86 and they can offload to the FPGA just like they could offload to any other offload today that we might offer like an encryption engine or a compression engine. So that's where we're headed.\", \"Your second question on NFV, SDN. So today, there are lots of capabilities that exist on the platform that sit next to the CPU. There are I/O devices like Ethernet controllers. There are other discrete accelerators like compression encryption devices or FPGAs. And if you think about NFV, it's very much like server virtualization. We have a hypervisor and then you have virtual machines. And there are well established methodologies today on how a virtual machine can access hardware resources outside the CPU, things like single-root I/O virtualization and other custom techniques that people like VMware and others have invented. So I think they're complementary. Your network function can operate in the absence of an accelerator and all run in software on top of the general purpose CPU. But if the accelerator is present and the hypervisor exposes it, which it needs to do to the virtual machine, then the virtual machine has access to those resources. So it's a pretty well understood technical problem. Yes?\"]}}, {'@id': '0', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': 'David?'}}, {'@id': '3', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': 'Thanks. You mentioned both in-package and on-die FPGA accelerator implementations.

And so our current plan is on-package. You could imagine that we're looking at on-die for the future, but we don't have any current plans that we're ready to announce on that, and I really don't know what the mix is going to be between them. But there are always going to be just the normal trade-offs of what are you trying to accomplish and cost, performance, and things like that that we'll take into account.

I hope this has been informative, and hopefully you share in our excitement for the Data Center business and our growth projections. So we talked about our fundamental business is microprocessors.

The buildout of the cloud architecture, not just the cloud service providers, but the comms work that Sandra talked about, moving them to a cloud environment; as well as enterprise, getting enterprise to deploy private clouds.', \"Big data is another way that we're accelerating in the market, and you heard Jason talk about what we're doing to accelerate big data deployment; that it's too complex today, but we're making investments in things such as Discovery Peak to try to accelerate that market as well.\", \"Then network we talked about.

That has been such a dominant portion of the market.\", \"Now what we're seeing is it's not a top-seven game anymore, it's really a top 10. Some of those in the top seven aren't in order anymore. There are other guys that have come in, so that diversification of the market and then just this long tail of SaaS offerings, software-as-a-service offerings that tend to be a very nice bolster to our business, they're not as price sensitive.

So I think Jason did a great job talk talking about the investments that he's making to make it easier for your standard enterprise IT shop to deploy a cloud environment.

You need to move all of those workloads onto Intel architecture, and that's what makes it a slow move. It's like one at a time, redesign, rearchitect, port the code, prove it out, deploy it, and rinse and repeat over and over and over. So it really becomes a capacity statement. I think the good news is the end users at the end see the value. They're like okay, we've got to move all that stuff over onto Intel Architecture over to  sales (3:31:51), so that's good.

That's where you'll see continued investments. And I think we've demonstrated that with the recent announcement of Rackspace, so an investment that we're making in Rackspace, both an engineering investment into OpenStack as well as deploying clusters, large clusters so that the OpenStack community can actually prove out those systems. And then just on Monday the announcement of investment in Mirantis, so helping Mirantis scale and reach more of those enterprise customers in deploying cloud solutions. So you will see more of those. And we said when we announced Cloud for All, we said that you'll hear 15 to 20 more of those types of announcements over the next 12 months.

You've done a great job I think of laying out the long-term vision and the diversification of growth in your business. Investors are not – no matter how long term we want to appear, we're not the best at having a long-term horizon sometimes. But maybe you could talk a little bit – and I asked Stacy this last week at IDF about visibility in your business in the near term. So there's the 19% growth in Q1, 10% in Q2. There are a few concerns about the back half of the year, the length of visibility that you have in your business both on the enterprise side and of the big cloud guys. That would be really helpful.

They're tuning their algorithms all the time. They're deploying more infrastructure all the time. They're trying to gauge how much capacity they need because it's a big CapEx spend. They don't want to spend without the demand being there. So they even have trouble anticipating what next quarter's demand is going to be. So that is where you get the variability.\", \"I think the network conversion has been extremely predictable. Sandra has hit her POR or exceeded her POR every single quarter for umpteen quarters now, so that's a very predictable market for us. Enterprise is generally very predictable. I agree, in Q2 it was softer than we anticipated, but it's generally pretty predictable, and we're confident in the buyout of second half for enterprise. We know they need to procure. On the cloud side, as it becomes a bigger and bigger portion of our business, that's where the unpredictability comes from.

And I think that's why we can point very clearly to diversification of the cloud service provider market. There are more services coming online. So it's great that Google and Amazon continue to get more efficient in the way they run their data centers. They're the best in the world at it, Microsoft best in the world at it.

Now my car – the car is  my fleet (3:41:10), 10 million, VW was saying 10 million cars coming online, connected cars coming online every year, 10 million devices. Now that I have this huge car fleet, think of the new business models, think of the new services I can deploy once I have that cloud computing model.\"}, \"So I do think the more efficient we can make it – just look at virtualization, server demand went up, not down. When you virtualize your server, when you deploy cloud computing and you make it more efficient, people invent new services to deploy across that infrastructure. That's true with enterprise and that's true with public cloud service providers. It's true with the comm service providers, and they have a list of new services that they're going to deploy and monetize once they get to where they can have an automated cloud-based environment. There are location-based services that just weren't possible when you had all these dedicated fixed-function boxes. So I think it's an amazing innovation cycle that will continue.

Some of these factors may affect our future results and financial condition.\", \"Today, Sergio will take you through our highlights for 2019, strategic priorities and targets. Kirt will then cover our fourth quarter results followed by the Q&A.\", \"Now, over to Sergio.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"2\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Thank you, Martin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start with a brief summary of last year's performance. We closed 2019 on a high note with $1.2 billion in adjusted PBT, the best fourth quarter since 2010. For the year, our net profit to reached $4.3 billion and return on CET1 capital was 12.4%. Clients continued to turn to UBS for high quality advice and solutions to help them achieve their goals. Today, we manage over $3.6 trillion of their assets, up nearly $1 trillion in four years. Last year, we further improved the resource usage and progressed on our strategic initiatives, cut operating expenses by 4%, optimize over $30 billion in LRD and invested in people and technology. Also, we signed strategic partnerships in Brazil and Japan to further enhance our scale and as you saw this morning, we announced a strategic combination of our funds platform with Clearstream.\", \"Our capital position is very strong, with an 80% total payout. We, again, delivered a very attractive returns to our shareholders. Obviously, the initial verdict in the French cross-border matter was very disappointing to us and to our shareholders. As you know, we have appealed the ruling and are preparing for the trial scheduled in late Q2. Overall, we had solid performance in mix market conditions and continued to see room for further growth and higher returns going forward. In contrast to consensus expectations from late 2018, we and our clients were impacted by sharp changes in macroeconomic and market conditions during the year. In 2019, interest headwinds intensified, global growth slowed and geopolitical concerns persisted, pushing many of our institutional and private clients to de-risk and stay on the market sidelines.\", \"Volatility, a key driver of revenues particularly for our institutional business remained muted and ended the year near historic lows. There were some positives late in the year, recession concerns in the US abated and investor sentiment improved supported by progress on global trade discussions and Brexit while US equity markets reached all-time highs. As we start the year, while the macroeconomic and geopolitical situation remains uncertain, positive market sentiment persists. We also see higher activity from our clients supporting the typical first quarter seasonality. Our aspiration is to deliver returns in line with the best global peers. Our last year's performance was not far off and we are intensifying efforts to improve it going forward by balancing growth, costs, and capital efficiency.\", \"For every bank, CET 1 is the metric which best reflects the equity it controls and deploys in the business and it is a binding constraint for capital returns. As you can see, we have by far the biggest gap between tangible equity and CET 1. For both these reasons, we choose to measure ourselves on return on CET 1 capital. Our clients expect to get the best from UBS every day. Our integrated business model is at the core of our strategy and it is how we best deliver to clients. Each of the businesses derives significant value from being part of the group and none of them would be as successful on their own. While we have been very successful in delivering our integrated model, we are further intensifying our one firm approach for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.\", \"Our priority for 2020 to 2022 is to drive higher and superior returns by growing each of our businesses, leveraging our unique, integrated and complementary business portfolio and geographic footprint. We are responding to changing business and competitive condition, and last but not least, our clients' needs. We know what we have to do. We have the talent, tools and reach to elevate UBS to the next level.\", \"For 2020-2022, it will be all about executing on these priorities starting with Global Wealth Management. We are a world-leading and the only truly global wealth manager with $2.6 trillion in invested assets across the entire wealth spectrum. We are well-positioned for future growth. In 2019, we made progress on some of our strategic initiatives, but clearly, we have more to do.\", \"As I mentioned before, clients have very high expectations about UBS' quality of services, products, and the way they interact with us. All of those needs are constantly evolving, in some cases, even changing rapidly driven by technology as well as competitive and social developments. I believe UBS is and always will at the forefront of best-in-class services to clients.\", \"For example, our leadership position in the sustainable space is affirmed by the $6 billion increase in our fully sustainable multi-assets mandate. What we continue to make a fundamental difference is the value of advice. As you can see, advice is a top priority for over 80% of our clients of all generations. In response to these developments, Iqbal and Tom have been and are actively implementing a series of actions that are aimed to further strengthen our leading position.\", \"First, we are amplifying our tailored coverage and offering across our entire client spectrum. We are expanding our global family office coverage which caters to clients who require the most bespoke, holistic and institutional style coverage. For clients at the lower end of the high net worth and affluent segments, we are developing solutions tailored to their specific needs.\", \"Second, we will be closer to clients. To do so, we are empowering local business units to accelerate decision-making processes and time to market. We are also delayering and simplifying our organization to better capture opportunities within our geographic footprint. Third, we are expanding our product offering and increasing efficiency. We will continue to invest in tech solutions and platforms, optimizing processes, supporting our advisors and increasing their productivity.\", \"Many of our richest clients have wealth in liquid assets and require help to unlock its potential through lending and liquidity management products. To better cater to their needs and offer more sophisticated solutions, we are expanding acceptable collaterals types by using the IB's capabilities to manage risks. These actions will allow us to deliver on our existing goal of growing loan volumes by around $20 billion a year from 2020 to 2022, without compromising on our risk management and risk/reward standards. All these actions will support us in delivering 10% to 15% PBT growth per annum in 2020-2022 which expand our pre-tax profit margins.\", \"Another element helping us to achieve our target will be our approach to net new money growth. We have always believed that in this regard, quality beats quantity. Now, we manage the trade-off between net new money growth and our PBT will be even more important considering the outlook for euro and Swiss franc interest rates. So, as I said in the past, we are not chasing net new money at the expense of our shareholders. Kirt will expand on this later on.\", \"Our Investment Bank brings essential value and expertise to clients requiring more sophisticated solution and first class execution. We have a leading position in many areas where we choose to compete and we will continue to invest in our digital, research and banking capabilities to better advise and serve our clients. In terms of profitability, clearly, we cannot be satisfied with our performance in 2019. We took actions and are working hard to improve revenues and profitability. For 2020, we expect to deliver returns of around 11% with further improvement in 2021 and 2022. Over the next three years, we expect the IB to consume up to a third of the group's risk weighted assets and LRD.\", \"The IB's cooperation with Global Wealth Management is essential to delivering a truly differentiated client offering particularly to our GFO and ultra clients with more sophisticated needs. In the GFO areas, we are leveraging both capital markets and wealth management capabilities to offer unmatched services, and in return, they do more business with us; on average, 15% growth in revenues.\", \"For that reason, we are expanding the GFO coverage following the re-segmentation I mentioned before. We are more than doubling the number of clients in this area solidifying our position as the house bank for these clients. That makes GFO a meaningful contributor to our profit growth objective. In addition, we are increasing our collaboration around lending by leveraging the IB's risk management capabilities. And on the execution side, we are combining capabilities across the group to enhance our client offering in the middle market segment, which includes large family offices and small hedge funds.\", \"I'm very pleased with the progress we made in Asset Management last year as our investments and efforts are starting to pay off. Going forward, we will continue to build on our areas of strengths particularly in sustainable offerings where we are a clear leader with nearly $40 billion in sustainability-focused invested assets. Also, we are investing and developing our capability in fast-growing markets by expanding on our partnerships in the wholesale space and leveraging our expertise in private markets and alternatives.\", \"Let me provide an example of the value for both clients and shareholders from deploying asset management capabilities to our US Wealth Management business. Separately managed accounts are one of the fastest growing areas in Wealth Management in the US. In order to capture this opportunity, we have eliminated separate management fees for SMAs managed by asset management. This decision will help us to increase mandate penetration for GWM, generate higher share of wallet and lead to significant inflows for asset management. We have already seen a very positive reaction from our clients and advisors, and we expect this initiative to be accretive to shareholders in few quarters.\", \"Our P&C business has generated growth and attractive returns despite severe interest rate headwinds. Yet we are determined to grow revenues and further improve profitability going forward. Technology plays a key role in this effort, particularly in responding to new market entrants and evolving clients' preferences. We will continue to roll out mobile and platform solutions to improve both individual and corporate clients' experience. Enhancements to our digital capabilities are already driving increased engagement and attracting new customers. Technology also helps us streamline and simplify processes and optimize our branch network, reducing them in numbers and evolving their formats to better serve clients.\", \"On negative interest rates, we will continue to manage the impact to protect our profitability. Our universal bank in Switzerland with P&C at its core is a great example for the rest of the group showcasing the power of close collaboration, creating value for clients and shareholders. It is also the reason why UBS is the number one bank in Switzerland.\", \"Shifting gears to expenses, we have consistently driven our cost base down, reducing costs by $900 million in 2019 alone. Since 2015, overall operating expenses were reduced by $2.7 billion. We generated significant sales to lower our cost base while funding investments in growth oriented projects and absorbing higher regulatory requirements. Last year, we spent $3.4 billion on technology which included our investment in transformation to make us more efficient and effective. A few examples are moving processes to the cloud, decommissioning over 400 legacy application and deploying 1,100 robots.\", \"In Global Wealth Management, we invested over $100 million in our strategic initiatives including development of ultra-high net worth capabilities and increasing our presence in APAC. We remain committed to improving efficiency and productivity in 2020 keeping net cost, excluding variable compensation and litigation, flat. Maintaining investment in technology and platform is crucial for growth, for growth of our franchise and for generating attractive returns in the future. This means that in order to fund all the necessary investments, we have to deliver $1 billion in gross saves during the year.\", \"I already touched on many efficiency initiatives across our business division. This includes, for example, the continued insourcing of workforce and development of our near-shore centers. We are determined to deliver positive operating leverage and bring our reported cost-income ratio within the 75%-78% range. In the past, I have always underlined our need to realize scale by seeking partnerships with other firms in attractive geographies, markets and services. In 2019, we made very good progress in this area. Our joint venture with SuMi Trust went live earlier this month while in November, we agreed with Banco do Brasil to create the biggest investment bank in South America.\", \"On the technology side, our partnership with Broadridge, a global fintech leader, has started to deliver initial releases which will continue over the next couple of years. This will help support our growth ambitions by building a market-leading integrated platform for our advisor that is focused on improving our efficiency and ease of doing business. And finally, today, we announced our partnership with Clearstream to combine our B2B fund distribution platforms to create the world's second largest player with a presence in Europe, Switzerland and Asia.\", \"Now, let's talk about the returns. A testament to the strength of our business model is the amount of capital we generated, $28 billion since 2011 including $5 billion last year. We achieved that while absorbing over $10 billion of mostly legacy litigation charges.\", \"During this period and adjusting for dividends, we have grown our tangible book value per share by 6% annually. This puts us in line with the average of American firms and higher than the average of our European peers.\", \"Capital strength is one of the pillars of our strategy. We are committed to maintaining a strong position going forward, while funding growth initiatives, accruing capital in anticipation of Basel III finalization and delivering attractive capital returns.\", \"For 2019 financial year, we intend to propose a dividend of $0.73 per share, up 6% year-on-year. Going forward, we intend to grow our dividend per share by $0.01 per year. This will give us greater capacity to return more capital through buybacks. Considering our high cash percentage payout and the fact that our stock trades below book value, for me, this is a no-brainer.\", \"In the first half of 2020, we expect to be back around $450 million worth of shares completing our CHF 2 billion program. In the second part of the year, we will assess further buybacks depending on business outlook and any idiosyncratic developments. So, tying all of these together, you can see on the slide our target framework for 2020-2022. We target between 12% and 15% return on CET1 capital and expect to deliver positive operating leverage as we work towards our target cost/income range of 75% to 78%. We have stress tested these goals, and we are confident that they are achievable across a wide variety of macro and market outcomes. Of course, the updated targets do not mean we are any less ambitious; and we are working hard to maximize returns.\", \"So, to briefly summarize our key points for today, our integrated business model is at the core of our strategy, and it is how we deliver our best to clients. We want to grow by leveraging our unique, integrated and complementary business portfolio and geographic footprint. We have a clear set of initiatives, and 2020 is all about execution. My goal for this year is clear: deliver on our targets and position UBS for an even greater future.\", \"Now, Kirt will take you through the fourth quarter results.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"3\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Thank you, Sergio. Good morning, everyone. As usual, my comments will compare year-on-year quarters and reference adjusted results in US dollars, unless otherwise stated. Given 4Q 2019 is the last quarter for which we have restructuring expenses related to our legacy cost program, we will no longer disclose adjusted results.\", \"From the first quarter of 2020 onwards, we will refer to reported results, while still highlighting items that are not representative of underlying business performance. We expect to incur around $200 million in restructuring, mainly in the first half of 2020, related to additional cost actions across the group, including the changes we announced in Global Wealth Management.\", \"This was our best fourth quarter adjusted PBT since 2010. Revenues increased by 4% and expenses decreased by 7%, as 4Q 2018 included large litigation provisions and a market backdrop at the end of 2018 was extremely challenging. PBT more than doubled, and was up 30%, excluding litigation. Net profit also increased significantly to $722 million.\", \"Moving to our businesses, in Global Wealth Management, excluding litigation from both quarters, PBT was up 3%. We also saw healthy volumes of net new loans, while invested assets and mandate balances both reached new highs, providing good momentum into 1Q 2020. Excluding a fee from P&C, operating income increased by 1% on higher transaction-based income, offsetting lower recurring fees and net interest income. I'll cover revenues in more detail in a moment.\", \"Expenses increased by 3% excluding litigation, mainly driven by higher tech and regulatory costs, partly offset by our savings initiatives. Costs would have been broadly flat, excluding litigation and the rise of various regulatory expenses and several non-recurring items.\", \"As part of our cost management actions, we generated $270 million run rate saves, exceeding the $220 million we previously guided to. In addition, in response to the environment this year, we have been very disciplined on the hiring front, with total head count down 4%, resulting in a reduction in personnel expenses, excluding FA and variable compensation, while still funding strategic priorities.\", \"In terms of net new money, we had $5 billion net outflows globally, with APAC and Switzerland reporting net inflows. In the Americas, there were two large outflows which contributed to the negative net new money result, although these were very low margin. Full year net new money was particularly strong in APAC with $31 billion of net inflows or an annualized growth rate of nearly 9%, further highlighting UBS' attractiveness to our clients.\", \"We remain confident in our ability to generate net new money growth. However, as Sergio highlighted, we will continue to focus on quality and, more specifically, on the profitability and resource efficiency of the existing invested assets and net flows.\", {\"mark\": {\"@type\": \"indiscernible\"}, \"#text\": \"With euro and Swiss franc rates remaining persistently negative in 2019 and the prospect of rates recovering off the table for the foreseeable future, we will launch a program focused on selected clients with high concentrations of deposits in euro and Swiss franc cash. Specifically, we will offer these clients the option to consolidate their assets with us, invest, reprice or reduce their cash balances. $1 billion reduction of such balances has a positive revenue impact of up to $5 million, and reduces HQLA  (00:27:44) capital. This will, of course, create headwinds to net new money. You may recall that we successfully implemented similar programs in 2015 and 2017. Sequentially, we had $2 billion net new loans, gaining momentum after the deleveraging in 4Q 2018 and muted inflows in the first half of 2019.\"}, \"Back to revenues, recurring fees were down 1%. Fees were impacted by margin pressure from client preferences for mandates and other investments with lower fees which we noted throughout the year. Recurring fee margin had been stable over the previous three quarters, but declined in 4Q 2019 mostly as we bill our clients and book fees in arrears. We, therefore, have not yet fully captured the rise in invested assets that we saw during the quarter, but the record invested asset base entering the new year gives as good recurring fee momentum into 1Q 2020. Net interest income was down 3%, driven by lower revenues from both deposits and loans, partly offset by higher investment of equity income and reduced interest paid to central banks.\", \"Transaction-based income was up 26% or 14%, excluding a $75 million fee paid by P&C for the shift in business volume following a segmentation review. The 14% increase reflects higher client activity levels in all regions. We saw particularly strong engagement in structured products with clients turning to us for yield enhancements and protection in response to the persistently low and negative rate environment and to lock in gains from the strong market rally in 2019.\", \"Performance in P&C was strong with PBT up 2% in Swiss francs, despite the fee paid to Global Wealth Management I mentioned earlier. Excluding this and litigation costs in 4Q 2018, PBT would have been up 11%. Full year PBT would have been up 5% on the same basis.\", \"For the quarter, net interest income was down 4% as lower investment of equity and higher TLAC funding costs were partly offset by reduced interest paid to central banks. NII was flat sequentially. Noninterest income was up 5%, excluding the fee paid to GWM, mostly as transaction revenues rose on increased foreign exchange, brokerage and credit card activity and reached a record level for the full year.\", \"Credit loss expense improved by $24 million as we saw a net release in 4Q 2019 versus a build in 4Q 2018. Business momentum remains very strong with 2.8% annualized net new business volume growth in Personal Banking for the quarter and a record 4.7% for the full year. We also onboarded 37,000 net new clients in Personal Banking during the year and over 1,000 net new clients on our Digital Corporate Bank. Cost decreased 9%; or 3%, excluding litigation.\", \"Asset Management had an exceptionally strong quarter, capping off a strong year. 4Q PBT was up nearly 50% to $187 million. For the full year, PBT was up 17% to the highest level since 2015. 4Q operating income was up 18%, driven by performance fees which increased by 240%. The significant increase resulted from strong investment performance in equities and hedge fund businesses in a constructive market environment in recognition of full year performance on certain larger mandates under IFRS 15. Management fees were up 4% reflecting higher average invested assets.\", \"Costs rose by 7% due to higher variable compensation related to the increase in revenues. Invested assets were up 5% during the quarter to the highest dollar level we've had. Full year net new money of $18 billion was led by equities in the wealth management channel and has come in at higher margins in aggregate than our average book of business margins.\", \"Our IB PBT was around $250 million excluding litigation, rebounding from a very weak 4Q 2018 on 11% revenue growth and lower costs. Overall, our revenue results were largely in line with our US competitors. CCS revenues were up 18%, outperforming fee pools globally, with increases in all regions and most products. Advisory revenue increased 25% versus a 25% decline in the M&A fee pool with outperformance in EMEA and APAC.\", \"ECM was up 18% in the cash ECM fee pool. In debt capital markets, investment-grade revenues were up more than the market at 58%, while LCM was down 5% against a higher people. Our equities revenues were up 2% driven by 8% increase in derivatives. Cash was down 6% as client activity was depressed and volatility remained at low levels.\", \"FRC was up 41%, excluding the $53 million for rebalancing the group balance sheet to dollars in 4Q 2018, driven by significant increases in rates and credit. FX was down 12%, excluding the aforementioned fee for the currency repositioning due to extremely low volatility. In research, we retained our number one position in the 2019 Institutional Investor's Global Equity Research ranking for the third year in a row. IB costs were down 7% excluding litigation, benefiting from lower personnel expenses. In 4Q 2019, we took a goodwill impairment of $110 million in the IB, which we adjusted for.\", \"Risk-weighted assets and LRD were both down from the prior quarter and remained below one-third of the group's resources. I would like to provide further details on our approach to managing efficiency that Sergio commented on earlier. Over the next three years, we expect our operating income to grow, supported by the business division and group actions Sergio highlighted.\", \"Under an operating income growth scenario, we will manage the flat overall costs to drive positive operating leverage. If we see the environment deteriorating, we will assess and take further actions to reduce our costs to mitigate the impact on the current year as we did in 2019. The combination of these tactical actions with our strategic initiatives allowed us to take costs down by about $1 billion on an adjusted basis or 4% compared with a 4% reduction in operating income.\", \"One area where we've been active in driving efficiency is insourcing technology head count. IT and other services outsourcing costs are down more than $250 million or 19%, partly offset by higher personnel expenses, and we are reducing risk and improving effectiveness. Other areas we brought down during the year are professional fees, marketing and PR costs, and travel and entertainment expenses, down $230 million in aggregate or 13%.\", \"In 2020, we expect revenue growth to be supported by positive alpha momentum, offsetting the anticipated more challenging beta environment. From a cost perspective, we're planning to invest around $1 billion, including, for example, progressing our Broadridge partnership in the US, continuing with our various digital initiatives across all businesses, and investing in our China strategy along with regulatory and compliance priorities. We will fund these investments with $1 billion in plan phase to maintain flat costs excluding litigation and variable compensation, mostly across our support services, back and middle office function. This includes continuing to insource our technology, operation, and finance head count, integrating our execution platforms across the IB and GWM, deploying robotics, and digitizing our front to back processes, along with the reorganization we announced in GWM and the IB.\", \"Over the past two years, we have been progressively aligning our support functions such as TechOps finance and risk with the business divisions. We now operate the group with the majority of these functions either fully aligned or shared among business divisions where they have full management responsibility. Only a small residual set of activities are related to group in line with peers. Later this year, we intend to adopt our reporting to better reflect how we manage the groups.\", \"Our capital and leverage ratios rose to 13.7% and 3.9% at the end of the year, but our current guidance of approximately 13% and 3.7% CET1 capital and leverage ratio still holds. RWA was down 2% sequentially, the annual recalibration of the AMA model brought down op risk by $3 billion and market risk RWA decline, partly as a result of the very low prevailing market volatility. In the first quarter of 2020, we anticipate a roughly $3 billion regulatory related increase in our credit risk RWA, mainly from the implementation of the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which became effective on 1 January, 2020.\", \"We have previously guided on the approximate impact to Basel III finalization on RWA. As the implementation has now been extended by at least a year, the day one impact could be lower than our original guidance. But there is still too much uncertainty for us to provide an update.\", \"To close on the quarter's results, this was the best 4Q adjusted PBT we've had since 2010, capping off a solid 2019, given the mixed market environment. We remain focused on executing our strategy, pivoting the growth, scale and efficiency. Sergio outlined our seven priorities across our businesses, individually and in partnership as one firm. And we're already hard at work, using these to benefit our clients and drive higher return on capital.\", \"With that, we'll open up to questions.\"]}}]}, {\"@name\": \"Q&A\", \"speaker\": [{\"@id\": \"0\", \"plist\": {\"p\": \"Our first question comes from the line of Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs.

I just have one question, in a sense, so, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is the third time in three years that UBS has reduced the return target. So, I think in 2017, we went from a return on tangible equity target of 15% to a return on tangible, less deferred tax assets, of 15%, so that was a reduction. Then, in 2018, we went to a return on Core Tier 1 target of 15%, so that was a reduction and now we've cut to 12% to 15%.\", \"And I was just wondering I mean how sure are you that this is now the right target range, right? So, when you speak to investors and you say we've changed our return target for the third time in three years, but this time it's for real, it's staying, I was just wondering what gives you the confidence that this doesn't shift again?\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"2\", \"@type\": \"a\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Thank you for the question.

So, in that sense, your assessment is half right because the first change was mainly due to that.\", \"So, the methodology in October 2018, we announced the targets for the three years to come with a clear completely \\u2013 you remember September, October, completely different expectations on the macroeconomic outlook and the outlook for interest rates and also that are factors that are for sure determining part of how we drive growth and business, not necessarily just that but also very important.\", \"So, if I look at today, the methodology that we announced today is still the same. What we did this year in the planning cycle was to look at those external factor \\u2013 macroeconomic factors, reflect those factors into our three-year plan, which, de facto, you can see are translated into a reduction from 17% to the 15% top of the range.\", \"Now, the question you're asking about how confident we are. For sure, as I outlined in my remarks, the 12% to 15% target is a range that has been stressed under different and a variety of market condition assumptions. So, you can see that 12% as being the bottom that we believe is achievable even in stressed market condition, while in a more normalized environment, over the next three years, our goal is to get closer to the 15%. So, the range has to be interpreted as a range that takes in consideration different market conditions. So de facto, what I'm saying in other words, we took down our targets by 2 points on return on CET1 to reflect the changed market conditions.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"4\", \"@type\": \"q\", \"plist\": {\"p\": \"Thanks a lot.\"}}, {\"@id\": \"0\", \"plist\": {\"p\": \"The next question comes from Adam Terelak with Mediobanca.

I've got two questions, one about your revenue performance in Wealth, and second one about the share buybacks. So, to follow up from the previous question, your revenue performance in the fourth quarter was actually quite robust, and I thought that was quite encouraging to see your NII and your transactional business also holding up. And, of course, given that in the US you kind of charge differently, you will have that 1Q uplift you've just talked about.\", \"But if we look kind of further out into 2020 and we think about the NII side, of course, the rates against loan volumes, we think about your transactional business, you've been quite positive about kind of 1Q trends overall, how do you see the overall revenue progression in Wealth, given the building blocks of NII transactions and of course the recurring fees that you've talked about a little bit, because I kind of wonder how you see particularly the 2020 PBT growth of like 10% to 15%,where is it really coming from, revenues versus costs?\", \"And of course, it would be very useful for \\u2013 if you could give us any kind of details of the GWM portion of the $200 million restructuring charge kind of within that 2020 context.\", \"And my second question is really how should we think about the assessment of the share buybacks in the second half of 2020?

Thank you.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"2\", \"@type\": \"a\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Thank you, Magdalena. So, let me take the second question, and Kirt will take the first one. So, on the share buyback, as we announced, we intend de facto to do half of what we did last year in the first half of the year. And of course, what I think that your question specifically, what I believe has to be well understood is our intention is clearly to, depending on \\u2013 mainly on the outcome of the idiosyncratic event, of course we are referring to the French matter, we believe it's only prudent and pragmatic not to go into any aggressive capital return policy, while the finalization of \\u2013 and the verdict of the appeal is likely to come towards the end of Q3 or early part of Q4. In that respect, maybe what I would like the market to understand is once everybody can make their own risk-based assessment about the outcome of this trial in different scenarios is, first of all, the entry point on January 1 of our capital position. And considering that, as I mentioned and Kirt reiterated, we are still confirming that we see our CET1 ratio being towards the 13% and there \\u2013 and the 3.7% on leverage ratio.\", \"Number two, taking consideration, well, other than business performance as we continue to generate capital as we did in 2019, our ability to absorb any extraordinary event within a normalized range has to be taken in consideration. Number three, what we announced this morning with the combination of our Fondcenter capabilities with Clearstream creates capital tailwinds. I guess I answered the question. Everybody can assess including the fact that we always say that we will retain extra capital, only if it's necessary to grow our business, fulfill incoming and expecting regulatory requirements, Basel III finalization, and, again, as I mentioned before, any idiosyncratic event. So, I'm pretty confident that we will continue to deliver, over time, a very strong capital return to our shareholders.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"3\", \"@type\": \"a\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Well, Magda, on your first question, first of all, that was quite a first question. Let me try to take it in the revenue components. In terms of recurring fees, first of all, naturally that's going to be a function of invested assets, so the growth that we saw towards the end of the year will help us in the first quarter. Naturally, we'll also have some impact overall on the relative mix risk. So it comes down to our clients' attitudes, geopolitical attitudes, and of course, importantly, its continued mandate penetration. And that remains a clear focus for both Tom and Iqbal. We would still view that compared to competitors in the US for example, we're relatively lower penetrated and under contract and we see good opportunities for increasing our penetration.\", \"Related to that as well, thematic investing is something we highlighted. We think there's significant opportunities in there. There's tremendous demand around thematic investing, for example, around aging, health, genetics, and the like along with sustainability and we're leaders in all of those areas.\", \"Now, in terms of NII, clearly if we do nothing else, we will see our NII come down, just because of the headwinds that are already built into the forward rates. That's clear. So, naturally, lending becomes the most important way for us to continue to offset those headwinds. And we talked about the lending momentum we saw in the second quarter, the focus on expanding collateral classes, increasing the level of lending we're doing across single stocks. Moving into commercial lending, we're looking at business lending. So there's quite a bit of activity around that lending. And that of course importantly leverages the IB capability in terms of how they risk-manage the book.\", \"Now, finally, around our transaction revenue, first of all, we're pretty pleased with the momentum we see. We do believe going forward, as clients are currently more active, and you saw that in our outlook statement for the first quarter. We do think structured products continues to be an opportunity in this environment, continued yield enhancement locking and gains. We combined our capital markets teams between the IB and Wealth Management. And we're deploying those to be closer to clients. And I would mention just one other area of growth opportunity, and that's GFO.\", \"So, if you look at slide 13, the fact that we're increasing our GFO clients to 1,500, and you see the compounded annual growth when we onboard a GFO client at 15% a year.

The cost base, ex litigation, ex restructuring, sort of, underlying ex everything, was a bit higher in 4Q. It was sort of $3.3 billion compared to sort of $3.1 billion, $3.2 billion in previous quarters. So, I just wondered if you could talk about that increase and whether that's a new sort of run rate going into next year.\", \"And then second question on the Investment Bank, I know you've sort of touched on some of this, but could you be a bit more specific about what specific items you see that will get the return on equity from sort of 6% reported, 8.6% underlying up to the 11% that you envisage for 2020? What are the specific revenue or cost things that changed that will get you there?\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"3\", \"@type\": \"a\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Yeah. Thank you, Jeremy. So, on the wealth cost side, I mentioned in my speech that if you exclude in the quarter some areas of spend related to regulatory requirements, for example, we've been building up cost, a portion of which are one-time, in order to address the higher bar, the higher regulatory bar for AML KYC requirements. Some of that cost will come down as we get in, in particular, to the second quarter, though still remain a little bit elevated in the first quarter.\", \"And then, outside of that, we also had a number of one-time items including some impairment for property and some other related costs that will not repeat themselves. So, in aggregate, that total bucket is around $45 million to $50 million. We'll see, as I said, a portion of that in the first quarter, but that should come down over time. So, it's really not representative of the ongoing cost structure of the Wealth Management business.\", \"Now, in terms of the IB, if you look at the reorganization that we announced that will allow us to deploy capital and technology in a much more agile way across for example the different asset classes within the markets businesses, which we think will give us return upside. In addition to that, the way we've reorganized our global bank and we talked about this to be able to create much more focused teams on the industry globally rather than organizing ourselves on a regional basis that we think that also will give us upside, plus as well where we've announced that the private markets group which we launched, we already see very good momentum there.\", \"And very importantly for us, it is the Investment Bank, the partnership, and the relationship with GWM, that GFO initiative that we highlighted, a portion of that one bank revenue will also benefit the IB. And so, we think with all of that and we're already starting to see some good momentum.

I think that we're going to continue to look at the costs, all the cost in a very challenging \\u2013 and the capital consumption as well. So, the allocated capital of the IB will always be further scrutinized and enhanced and improved.\", \"So, in a sense, what we are saying is that 2019, as I mentioned before, is not an acceptable outcome. I do believe that we will go back more into the last few years' historical pattern. I think that you saw that in seven, eight years, we were on average 13.7%. I think that we had 11% in 2017 \\u2013 2016 and 2017 around. So, I \\u2013 we are quite confident that we can go back into that double-digit number, and from there, to start to go for higher returns. So, it's not that we are happy with that 11% return right way. So, I think that, while the IB is crucial to make sure that many parts of the organization, not only GFO and Wealth Management, but also the Corporate business in Switzerland remains competitive, the IB has to deliver better results on its allocated capital.

Credit Suisse has obviously talked about moving towards 35% pro forma for RWA inflation and that's why they felt comfortable reducing their Core Tier 1 ratio target to 12%.

We saw in the press a couple of weeks ago, there were some job and cost cuts expected in GWM, but there wasn't any mention of the additional net cost saves here today. So, just wanted to check your comments here, Kirt, that the restructuring charges you're taking will give you gross cost saves, but that will all be reinvested. And then, if revenues do disappoint, then you'd slow some of those investments and that would give a bit of protection for shareholders and profits. I just want a check if I've understood that kind of philosophy correctly, and may be connected to that, you could give some comments around how the growth investments from 2018 and 2019 have performed, and when there might be a payback on those.\", \"And then, secondly, you mentioned the recurring fee margin pressure. I understand the averaging of AUM and the delayed on \\u2013 charging on the start of the quarter, particularly in the US. But you did mention margin pressure as well. Is it right to think of that as all as being cyclical, i.e., it was client risk aversion within the fourth quarter, which you're now highlighting and your outlook statement is beginning to change around this quarter? Or is it that you're actually seeing some clients come to you and tell you they've been giving better pricing elsewhere that you will then having to match? I just want to understand what kind of margin pressure you're seeing there. Thank you.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"3\", \"@type\": \"a\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Yes, Andrew, thank you for the questions. In terms of the first one, you got it exactly right that, as we look at 2020, our anticipation is that we'll generate $1 billion in saves, and that we'll use that to fund $1 billion in investments that across a range of business priorities, digitization, what we're doing with Broadridge, as well as some additional regulatory and risk requirements that addresses the new requirements that we have with our legal entity structure and the like.\", \"Also, as you rightly summarized, if we do see softening of the environment just as we did in 2019, we'll look at tactical measures which would include postponing some of the investments, slowing down our hiring, getting, of course, much more ruthless around other cost areas of the bank and being leaner for some time. I think Sergio referred to that as a fuel saving mode, and we would bring our costs down rather than just flat, and that would help to offset some of the top line impact of softer environment. So that's all correct.\", \"In terms of investments and where they're paying off, I mean I think you see it very clearly, for example, in Asset Management where we had outstanding performance. You see them in P&C, the investments in digital are solidifying our position as the leading digital bank in Switzerland, and certainly have contributed to the growth well above of GDP that we've seen for that business. You're seeing in some of the structural saves. Sergio mentioned moving to cloud, deploying 1,100 robots. So, the gross saves that we delivered which are far higher than what we outlined on the $2.7 billion over the last four years are from some of our investments and are structural in nature and, therefore, required investments, and we're seeing that. So, without those investments, our cost structure would have been higher.\", \"And now, on the recurring fee margin, I think you are right. It's \\u2013 that's mostly reflective of some of the change in preference that we've seen a mandate, some move from discretionary mandates to advisory mandates, and that's partly due to the risk environment. Also, I mentioned that in the non-contracted book, we saw some shift out of equity funds into fixed income. I mean that was a big market structural change that we saw in the fourth quarter. And all of that, we would view as cyclical with a potential to revert, if we see changes and attitudes going forward.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"9\", \"@type\": \"q\", \"plist\": {\"p\": \"Perfect.

And what is the benefit you can see out of the investments you have taken over the last year?\"}, \"And then, secondly, you talk a lot about collaboration across divisions and I was wondering whether you could speak a bit more about the incentive structures to actually foster these collaborations and drive results.

They were impacted, as you would expect, they're more sophisticated clients, by the lower volatility. So, we did see slightly less activity. And we also saw quite a bit of deleveraging.

First of all, I have to say that really collaboration, we are already quite advanced and it is already part of our DNA in the way the firm works. So, of course, now we are moving to further levels up in that sense. But first of all, what we do is that we have collaboration targets somehow embedded in the performance metrics and the goals in the year at business division.\", \"We have a so-called Group Franchise Awards where people can submit their request for credit recognition, in respect of their involvements in any transaction or any opportunities that was created, like net new money inflows from a client, referrals, or a specific transaction with the other counterparty \\u2013 the receiving counterparty accepting in the system the credits requested.\", {\"mark\": {\"@type\": \"ph\"}, \"#text\": \"We are also moving into recognizing  a business at (01:11:52) division levels, the so-called double counting of revenues.

But we want to make it clear to the front offices that when they are involved in creating value for clients and shareholders, they do get recognized. And this is also reflected in the compensation accrual process. And last but not least, all my colleagues on the executive board, the vast majority of \\u2013 or the big chunk of their financial objectives is driven by the outcome of the bank results and not just their divisional one. So, the weighting is far superior there.\"}, \"So, top down and going down to group managing directors, everybody's aligned, first of all, how to create better value for client and shareholders as a group. And then of course, they are accountable and responsible for what they do day-to-day. That's the mechanism. But at the end of the day, it's also cultural approach because you don't want to be able to measure every single interaction with dollars.

First of all, on the targets and guidelines on the numbers, do you include Fondcenter in the numbers both in the cost income and ROE targets?

Clearly, there're a lot of structural changes happening in the US from the players like Morgan Stanley growing faster, gaining market share, looks like, i.e., the large players and then you can see that in the new pre-tax margin guidance that I'm sure you're aware of, and on the electronics side as well as the money centered banks which are consolidated and exchanging. I wanted to see where you stand because you're kind of in the middle and I'm wondering strategically what does it mean for your business, not over the next year or two, but even longer term out as the structure of the US market seems to be changing.\", \"And, secondly, I have a question regarding the ROE of 12%. You mentioned it is stress test for different macro scenarios. I'm just wondering if you could tell me what is your 12% macro scenario, i.e., the stress test at the bottom of the ROE guideline or guidance in order to realize of what is assumed in this number? Thank you.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"2\", \"@type\": \"a\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Thank you, Kian. I guess the second question really is very complementary to the first one or vice versa. So, I guess \\u2013 so, first of all, of course we include \\u2013 the target 12% to 15% is not a 2020 target. It's a multiyear target and the 12%, I reiterate as you just pointed out is, I would call, the low end of a stress scenario which I will not discuss definitely in public. Okay. So, that's quite normal. I appreciate that you asked the question. But I'm sure you appreciate that we don't really go through that, but you can expect this to be not a rosy picture on what would happen in financial markets or the economy when you look at the 12%.\", \"Now of course because we are \\u2013 we say that we're going to highlight any extraordinary item, but also during the three years in our reported numbers, Fondcenter will be part of this year results. You can extrapolate what it means for this year results. What I like to also underline is that the definition of what we believe is extraordinary versus the outcome of a process where we invest over time and then we are able to realize value is also something to be considered because in order to grow and maintain Fondcenter over the years, we have been recurring expenses that we're going through the operating line of expenses. And now that we realize value, while we continue to create value for shareholders and clients, we will also need to look at what it means from a management standpoint of view, taking actions to optimize our resource allocation. But in any case, to answer your question, 12% to 15% is reported and includes any of those items and the 12% is not a target. 12% is what we believe is an outcome if we have certain more stressed market conditions.\", \"So I would say, and Kirt, I'm sure we can step in with more data points that if you look at our growth trajectory in terms of invested assets in the US, they are very similar to the best in the US you are indicating. So, of course, they have a better pre-tax profit margin and we know that to some extent, we are working on making sure like we did in the last seven years, eight years where we were losing a couple of hundred millions \\u2013 in 2010-2011, not seven years, eight years, a little bit before \\u2013 we were losing $150 million a year in our Wealth Management business in the US. We got similar questions. By now, we are around $1.5 billion. So we believe this business will drive higher returns going forward because of higher mandate penetration, because we believe we have room to improve penetration of lending. We believe we have the space to grow in the ultra-space. And what I mentioned and Kirt reiterated, the Broadridge technology capabilities that we are rolling out is going to offset some of the scale issues that meant some of our competitors are enjoying.\", \"And last but not least, the quality of the earnings in the US, I cannot stop stressing the quality of the earnings in the US from a post-tax standpoint of view are absolutely critical and had added value.

So, it's difficult to see how you can reach your target for GWM pre-tax profit growth going forward. And I'm just wondering in my mind what you think are the main key pressure points for why you can't seem to get that growth in pre-tax profit and whether it's like the change in asset mix been the primary issue here or net interest margin pressure. It seems to be an issue across all your regions; not just in the US.

So, if you look at our Wealth Management business, first of all, you look at the history in the last number of years that obviously the largest headwind that we had was regular lives in the business and the very significant effort that we went through to address just the cross-border compliance of our business. And that resulted in several billion of total top line that would have been very accretive to our bottom line dilution over that period of time.\", \"If you look at just the last couple of years, as we saw that overall program tapering, there's a combination. Actually, our US business quite well. In fact, it's grown very consistently in line with US competitors; if you compare us to Bank of America or Morgan Stanley over the last couple of years, the international businesses have been a bit more challenged. And I think that's just in general because of the environment. The US market has performed better, but conversely we've seen negative rates in Europe as well as in Switzerland, of course. And then on top of that, Asia-Pacific has been very volatile and you've seen the drops overall in economic growth in China. And that we've seen deleveraging and we've seen therefore that part of our business perform a bit less well and I think that's very consistent with what we've seen in the overall market environment.\", \"Now, we still have great confidence in that business and our GWM's business ability to generate the 10% to 15% growth that we've outlined. We see very good momentum in the first quarter already and we've highlighted really all the actions and why we feel that confidence. And we can only emphasize that, for us, that's very much consistent with our strategy and what we expect to deliver over the next couple of years.\", \"Now on the RWA question, there were two factors that led to the reduction. One is we did our AMA model. I highlighted this in my speech. We did our yearly update with FEMA. That resulted in a $3 billion reduction in op risk RWA. Now we also had a reduction overall in market risk which I highlighted and that's really due to the very, very low volatility that we've seen and our VaR is extremely lower, particularly our stress VaR and I think that would come \\u2013 we would see actually an increase in market risk, RWA in part if we saw a rebound in volatility levels.

Can I just follow-up on the US side? I mean you're saying that you've got comparable performance with your US peers, but if I look at the revenues, there is a distinct difference in the growth profile there. And I'm also wondering, on the cost side whether there's a big difference as well. You change your payment grid. And I think you tried to make it much more Swiss-orientated rather than US orientated; so, trying to pay your advisors more to bring in more AuM per advisor. But I'm not sure whether that's really worth. If you look at the cost basis, the same AuM has gone up but your revenues, likewise, has been under pressure.

If we weren't to get to the 10% to 15%, what kind of pressure does that put on the 12% to 15% or is 10% baked into the 12% RoCET1 or is it just more flexed than that?\", \"And then secondly, I mean I'm just curious just on the commentary that you're not going to be giving the adjusted kind of results, obviously, recording out the items, but are we to take from that that I guess from your perspective, the kind of broader restructuring, et cetera, has done. And so, now it really is a kind of business as usual in terms of how you run, organize the group and so, what the kind of scenario analysis, restructuring, et cetera is really kind of more of a mute-point? Thank you.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"3\", \"@type\": \"a\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Yeah naturally, Amit. The overall growth in GWM is certainly integral to our achievement of the group targets in the progression that we see over the next three years. At the same time though, as Sergio mentioned, that we've stressed test are our targets overall. And you can imagine part of that stress test included what happens if GWM is not able to grow at its 10% to 15% level. And Sergio mentioned that under those stress scenario, we still feel comfortable achieving that 12%. So, that 10% to 15% helps to push us into the upper end of that 12% to 15% RoCET1 target.\", \"Now, on the adjusted side, you might recall that a couple of years back, we indicated that we would continue to adjust for our legacy costs program, and we actually had an accounting convention that allowed us to restructure or where we restructure and adjusted for the cost to achieve that program that tapered off as we went through the end of last year. And that's been fully tapered down to zero. So, last year was the final year where we had $200 million of restructuring related to that accounting. And so going forward, since we stopped that overall accounting convention, we'll just have more normal restructuring that we incur in the business, and we'll call that out as we indicated like the $200 million I already highlighted. And we'll cue off our reported results and give you the transparency.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"14\", \"@type\": \"q\", \"plist\": {\"p\": \"Okay.

Sergio, thank you very much for joining us on stage here again. I'll hand over to Sergio to take us through some slides, and then as always, we'll do some Q&A at the end.\"]}}, {'@id': '1', 'plist': {'p': ['Thank you. Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, I like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. You can also find this presentation on our Investor Relations webpage.', \"I'm going to use the time today to outline what UBS is and what we can do with the foundation we have, which in essence is all about answering the theme of this conference. We have outstanding global client franchises across our business divisions, which are underpinned by the strong UBS brand and where clients are at the center of everything we do. As the only truly global wealth manager and the leading universal bank in Switzerland, we are unique and we are positioning all our businesses to take advantage of growth opportunities.\", \"Managing for growth and efficiency means being disciplined on cost, A, to fund investments for the future but, B, also to remain lean. We are constantly adapting to changes in the operating environment and to anticipate the needs of our clients as well. That's the reason why we have to combine short-term tactical measures to protect our profitability and freeing up resources to allow us to respond to the structural shifts and proactively position UBS for the future. In essence, this means continuing to challenge both our plans and assumptions.\", 'Our starting position is very strong. Not only do we have a good business and geographic mix, we also have the balance sheet strengths to allow us to weather all seasons. We can deploy balance sheet and risk for clients and bottom-line growth in good times and navigate to the stress times by being disciplined with resources and focusing on sustainable growth. And we can balance a desire for capital strength with returning excess capital to shareholders. As we have also shown over the last few years, all these ingredients together should lead us to strong financial performance over the cycle.', \"The theme of the conference is about operating in a world of extremes. But as I see it, we have already been living in unusual times for quite a while now. For example, the introduction of the temporary measure of negative interest rates have now become the new normal. For one quarter of the time the euro has existed, the ECB has had negative interest rates, and it's now 11 years since the Fed has had quantitative easing.\", \"But in the last three years after repositioning our business, we have grown revenues in spite of all that. Recurring revenues, which make up around 60% of our operating income, have increased over the last three years. Transaction-driven revenues have remained stable overall, reflecting the abnormally low realized volatility in the market. At the same time, we built $4 billion of CET1 capital and still grew returns to a respectable 14.6% for the first half of this year. I'll draw out some evidence of growth over the next few slides.\", 'In GWM, we have had $90 billion of net new money inflows since the end of 2016, and invested assets have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 8% in that time, taking us to a record $2.5 trillion as of midyear 2019. Our global footprint is unique with broadly half of our invested assets in the Americas and half outside. So, comparing development to peers requires a little nuance.', \"As we highlighted in our Q2 2019 results, invested assets developing in the US is the only way for us to benchmark our net new money performance as US peers do not disclose this metric. While we have seen outflows in the Americas, our invested assets have grown in line with the peer average since 2016. That's when we completed the implementation of our operating model change in the US, focusing on retention and away from recruiting, which has had an adverse impact on net new money. This change in the model has contributed to us again delivering record profits in GWM Americas in Q2.\", \"And for the regions outside the Americas, which is more comparable to our peers who don't have a US footprint, we had a strong, on a relative and absolute basis, 4.6% CAGR just from net new money since 2016. We recognize that net new money is an important driver of growth for the business over the cycle. And while we will continue to focus on improving this metric, we will continue to focus also on the quality and sustainability, particularly when operating in a low or negative rate environment.\", \"We have been committed to APAC for over five decades through good and bad times. This unwavering commitment has helped us to earn leadership position in key business areas, including Wealth Management. In fact, I've just come back from Hong Kong last week for board meetings, and I met with clients and some of our local teams as well.\", 'In spite of the current environment, our goal is to grow even further in this fast-expanding region, both organically and through strategic partnerships. At our Q2 results, we discussed the SuMi Trust joint venture in Japan, which we are confident will be beneficial for both clients and shareholders. And we are exploring similar opportunities across the globe to scale our business effectively, efficiently, in line with our objective communicated in October.', \"For example, yesterday, we announced our intention to enter into a strategic partnership with Banco do Brasil to combine our respective investment banking capabilities and create a leading investment bank in South America. This is expected to cover investment banking services and institutional securities brokerage in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, leveraging access to Banco do Brasil's corporate clients and UBS's execution and distribution capabilities.\", \"We remain focused on pulling the strategic levers we discussed at our investor update last year and capitalizing on structural growth opportunities globally. I've just outlined one initiative, and another strategic opportunity I'd like to call out is the Global Family Office Group, which is a concept that, as you know, we pioneered almost a decade ago. The reason why this is one of our focus areas is because introducing GWM clients to this institutional coverage model, which is a joint venture with the IB, yields benefits for the clients in terms of holistic service and provide substantial revenue upside to UBS.\", \"After we transfer our Wealth Management client into GFO, revenues increased by around 15% CAGR on average mainly as a result of much higher volumes of transactions directly with the IB. It's a great example of how we can benefit from our clients and shareholders can benefit from our diversification and expertise.\", 'Moving to the topic of technology, which is pivotal to our ability to innovate for clients and improve the efficiency of our business. Technology is becoming more and more of a differentiator and our continuous investments are paying off. As you can see on the slides, we regularly receive external awards but, most importantly, our capabilities are also recognized by clients.', \"While our Wealth Management offering will continue to be primarily human-driven advice and coverage, we have successfully launched hybrid products for client segments that wouldn't normally have access to UBS's expertise and service. UBS Advice Advantage, our digital advice platform in the US, has been live for one-and-a-half years and has contributed to the strong growth in managed accounts we have seen in the US.\", \"But it's not only our scale that's benefiting clients. By partnering with Broadridge to develop our platform in the US, we are contributing to creating a utility for some of our more commoditized services in the value chain. This should reduce costs and improve the quality of the service our clients receive, and initiatives like this are important in helping us to achieve our targets to improve efficiency.\", 'We are a digital leader in Switzerland across both the private and institutional space, and we can leverage the Swiss capabilities across the firm. Wealth Management platform and Global Wealth Management, for example, was developed in Switzerland and subsequently rolled out across the world.', 'Investment banks are transforming and we are working hard to be at the forefront of these developments. Our historical areas of strengths, equities and FX, have evolved to become among the most electronified products for the industry. The fact that our equities and FX e-trading turnover has grown faster than the market as a whole indicates that our investments are paying off in this highly competitive space. But to be clear, this does not mean that we can or will get complacent now.', 'In the research too, we strive to be a market leader with our state-of-the-art alternative data platform, Evidence Lab. This has contributed to our number one position in the latest global research surveys. While we always keep an eye on short-term profitability, we remain committed to investing digital over the cycle. Technology investments are crucial, not only to maintain our share of wallet or market share and become more efficient, but also as an enabler for future growth.', \"Another important pillars of our strategic execution is the constant focus on optimizing the balance between revenue growth, cost and capital efficiency to drive returns. That's the reason why we are as focused on becoming more efficient as we are on using our financial resources effectively. Only by doing both we can free up or create the quality of profits that allow us to reinvest for growth and to deliver on our capital returns plans. As you can see from this chart, you should be indifferent between points along each line from an efficiency perspective. And our high capital efficiency is a balancing factor for our structurally higher cost/income ratio.\", \"Talking about costs, we also have to recognize that we are absorbing expenses related to regulation alongside self-funding growth and tech investments. I just outlined some of the things on our tech agenda, and that does not come without cost. But such investment also aren't really optional. And in order to fund that, we need to constantly find ways to cut and improve efficiency. Therefore, we are still committed to what we said at our investor update last year. We want direct expenses excluding variable compensation to stay broadly flat.\", \"Our ambition is to deliver world-leading returns, and this picture shows we are already delivering in line with the top peers but, of course, we still strive to improve from here. You'll notice that for benchmarking, we are using CET1 capital which is important, and the binding constraints on capital and the easiest to compare across banks.\", \"Let's take a look at tangible book value growth. In my opinion, in order to assess relative and absolute developments, we need to take cash dividend into consideration. We have paid out one-third of the tangible book value around $15 billion in dividends since 2011. That places us among the top of cash dividend payers in the industry. And naturally, this has an impact on the pure book value growth standing relative to peers. Adding back cash dividends, we are broadly in line with our US peers and compare favorably to the Europeans.\", \"Touching on the environment briefly, uncertainty has negatively impacted client sentiment, leading to inertia in trading in recent quarters. Volatility has been largely muted, but has been a campaign by short periods of extreme spikes and Q3 has been no exception. We recognize the headwinds from the low and negative rates, and we are optimizing our business for the evolving environment. That said it's worth remembering that net interest income is only around 20% of our revenues.\", \"The difficult start of the year weighed on our first half results, but we nonetheless reported good returns. Considering the limited visibility we have intra-quarter, it's difficult to predict how the year will play out. But regardless of how the external factors develop, we as a management team are committed to working tirelessly to improve financial returns.\", \"In conclusion, there are a few key messages I'd like to leave with you. We are operating from a position of strength with outstanding global client franchises today, and we intend to keep building on that. We have been and we will continue to position our businesses for growth, including investing in digital. We are committed to taking sustainability into account and providing solution for our clients to whom this is an important consideration. It is important to us, too, and we are honored to be recognized for that. Earlier this month, UBS was named the best performer for the fifth year running in the Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets industry of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the most widely recognized corporate sustainability rating. Improving efficiency is key to being able to fund growth investments and responding to evolving operating environment. Our capital strength also gives us some flexibility on these two fronts. And the last point I'll highlight, UBS has an attractive capital return profile. Our plan is to continue to pay dividends and buy back shares in accordance to our capital returns policy.\", \"With that, I'll hand it to Andy for the Q&A. Thank you.\"]}}]}, {'@name': 'Q&A', 'speaker': [{'@id': '0', '@type': 'q', 'plist': {'p': \"Thank you, Sergio. Thank you very much. If I'll kick off, there's already a couple of questions on the iPad, so I'll pick up one as well. You went through there that the – hitting back to the business plan from last year, the plan of calling for revenue growth with cost flat, as you've repeated there, I think it's fair to say for all the banks, the revenue side has struggled there. But you have continued those investments and growth moved into onshore China, the Sumitomo joint venture, the advisor hires. I guess from the market's point of view, is there any kind of stage where you would consider – where that plan would need to change on the cost investment?\"}}, {'@id': '1', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"Well, first of all, of course, we are continuing – continue to adapt our – how we execute on our strategy. And as we outlined at the beginning of the year, not only we are executing on those $800 million that we flashed in the investor update, the structural cost savings, but also we'd say that we have identified $300 million of tactical measures that are de facto a slowdown, what I call fuel save mode in respect of how we execute on our strategy.\", \"I don't see any major strategic initiative that can be basically cancelled or put aside because of the environment without naturally going and compromising our medium-term and long-term growth opportunities. We need to find tactical consideration. When you're on a $24 billion cost base, by definition, you always need to find something to save. And we are always looking at the $10 million, $50 million here and there, a few hundreds. But we are not definitely not talking about billions of cost savings without compromising our structure and our franchise.\", \"So at the same time, I would say that we have some levers to respond to the negative top line developments. Half of the growth that we identified last year is coming from alpha initiatives. It's not just basically getting the benefits of rates environment or a normalization of the trading environment for clients. So we have to really focus on executing on those initiatives and balancing a flat cost base excluding compensation.

I probably shouldn't ask that one. If I switch to Wealth Management, the gross margins which I know we like to look at profitability, but we all still look at gross margins. They've been under pressure for a while. I think the story in the second quarter ended up focusing on the net interest margins because that story is very fresh at the time as you said – I think you said that the net interest income is only 20% of your total revenue, so maybe if we focus on the fee side. There's also been pressure on that side of things but – and it looks because it's just through various different things, it always looks like it's structural. Do you think that structure is actually a part of that which is actually cyclical?

I mean, we have overcapacity in the industry and digitalization is creating potential new threats across the board and new entrants. So, there are structural issues that you need to keep in consideration. Other are more cyclical. I would say that even when I take out the more competitive nature of how deposits and profitability will develop over the years, there is a clear correlation that when rates eventually, I don't know when, will go up, you have been seeing some positive correlation in the last 24, 36 months.\", \"So transaction volume, the correlation of this with realized volatility in the market is clearly there. I mean, there is no volatility in financial markets. Both institutional shareholders and wealth management and private clients will trade less.

So, I would say it's mix-mix.\", \"The structural part of the equation has to be addressed by constant savings and improvements on how you operate. And that's the reason why in essence is absolutely critical to think about investing in technology to become leaner and more agile, more efficient because it's the only way you can compensate for on a net basis. So, gross margins are important, but at the end of the day, it's about protecting the net margins. And for us, it's very important since we have half – almost half of the $2.5 trillion are with ultra or GFO clients.

We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our operations in the fourth quarter. And then, Varun will dig into the segments, the related financial details, and then discuss our 2019 guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks.', 'Taken as a whole, we made good progress in the fourth quarter with the various operational initiatives we implemented throughout 2018. We did, however, experience some challenges in achieving the expectations we set forth in our previous guidance primarily related to our European operations.', 'Make no mistake; these challenges have not changed our focus on the four key things we outlined in our last call: our continued pursuit of profitable revenue growth, progress on our margin improvement plans, excellent cash conversion and the optimization of our capital allocation strategy.', \"Now, on to the quarter. As noted on slide 5, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3 billion, an increase of 22% over the $2.5 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2017. Parts and services' organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 2.5%.\", 'Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $40 million, a decrease of 68% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $0.13 a share as compared to $0.41 for the same period of 2017, a decrease of 68%.', \"The fourth quarter 2018 results include non-cash impairment charges, net of tax, of $48 million related to the company's equity investments in Mekonomen and $26 million related to goodwill recorded on our 2017 acquisition of an aviation parts recycler. These impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 by $0.23. Varun will address both these items in his commentary.\", 'On an adjusted basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders was $151 million, an increase of 19.7% as compared to the $126 million for the same period of last year. As noted on slide 6, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $0.48, an increase of 17.1% as compared to the $0.41 for the same period of 2017.', 'With respect to capital allocation, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the company repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $26.41, reflecting a $60 million return of capital to our shareholders. As stated during our last earnings call, our strong capital position and healthy cash flow affords us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers, while simultaneously utilizing a share repurchase program to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy.', \"Let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. As you would note from slide 7, organic revenue growth for parts and services in our North American segment was 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter of 2017.\", 'Excluding the impact for the battery contract with FCA, which just started on January 1, 2018, organic growth for the rest of the North American segment was 2.4%. Still, we continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims were down of 0.9% in the fourth quarter and up only 0.1% for the full year 2018.', 'We believe this outperformance in our growth relative to the CCC data is due to the continued increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot, that being model years three to 10 years old, and an 18% increase in the number of alternative parts utilized on a per claim basis over the past five years.', 'Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q4 was achieved, while miles driven in the United States were down 0.5% from October and up just 0.3% on a nationwide basis in November.', 'During Q4, the salvage line of business launched the implementation of a software platform that uses predictive analytics and multiple data input feeds to refine the analysis in calculating the most accurate part prices, which in turn will be used to determine the value of total loss vehicles to LKQ and provide more accurate pricing determination at the auctions. We believe the early stages of this price optimization effort played a key role in the organic growth for recycled parts, outpacing that of aftermarket parts in the fourth quarter and for the first time in 2018.', \"Related to our recycling business, I am proud of our North American team's environmental efforts in 2018. Between our full service salvage and self-service businesses, in 2018, we processed over 872,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 1.4 million catalytic converters, 2.2 million tires, 560,000 batteries, 2.4 million gallons of waste oil and over 4 million gallons of fuel. This effort is a key pillar in our mission of being a responsible steward of the environment and a true partner with the communities in which we operate.\", 'We also continued to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision SKU offerings and the total number of certified parts available, each growing 5.2% and 11.5%, respectively, in 2018. Our North American team continued to make solid progress with respect to the margin recovery efforts despite facing ongoing cost pressures primarily from wage, fuel and freight inflation. These efforts include being disciplined in terms of pricing and discounts, and realizing continued improvements with our telematics and Roadnet platforms.', 'During the fourth quarter, 96% of the 326,000 manifests in North America were created through Roadnet. With better routing and efficient trucks, fuel consumption and miles driven were reduced by 1.7%.', 'Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 47%, primarily driven by the acquisition of STAHLGRUBER. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 0.3%, reflecting a pullback from Q3 levels and well below our expectations. The European demand was soft across many of our key markets, including the UK, Benelux and Italy.', \"During the fourth quarter and full year, our Rhiag business witnessed negative growth in Italy. In Q4 2018, the Italian economy shrank by 0.2%, following a 0.1% decline in Q3. With that, Italy's economy officially tripped into recession and the economic contraction is expected to continue for some time, which could create a difficult market for our operations as well.\", 'Euro Car Parts posted organic growth in Q4 and full year 2018, but the quarterly results were well below our expectations. The UK continues to struggle with the Brexit negotiations and the economic uncertainty appeared to have a negative impact on overall demand, with most market participants reporting low single-digit organic growth.', 'STAHLGRUBER performed in line with expectations, but we are closely monitoring the economic conditions in Germany, which have shown signs of a slowdown. When looking at Europe as a whole, a soft economic outlook has shaped our expectations for our 2019 organic revenue guidance.', 'Regarding Brexit, the whole world is waiting to see what comes of the ever changing discussions, both within the UK and between the UK and the EU. A couple of key risks revolve around the fact that most of what is consumed in the UK, including automotive parts, originates outside of the UK. Indeed, a majority of the inventory purchased by ECP and Andrew Page comes from EU countries. Accordingly, a further weakening of the sterling relative to other currencies could inflate the cost of procurement. And any trade disruptions in terms of getting inventory into the country could create issues in servicing customer demand. With respect to the currencies, we do hedge a portion of our expected inventory purchases a few months forward using FX contracts.', \"On the product front, all of our UK-based businesses have been working to ensure we have a minimum number of months' coverage on all types of inventory, including fast movers, mid-movers and even certain slow moving SKUs. This has involved a variety of activities, including placing advanced orders, increasing stock holdings at ECP facilities and working with key suppliers to have them create buffer stock at their facilities within the UK prior to the end of March.\", \"The interest of ECP and our suppliers are directly aligned and we have been working proactively with these partners. Several of which have extended payable terms to offset the cash impact of building inventories. While there are many unknowns related to how Brexit will impact the UK and Europe, we believe we have the broadest and deepest inventory in the market and are confident that we will be able to meet our customers' needs.\", \"While the overall European market weakness has provided some headwinds, we are also actively addressing the company's specific operating challenges we've experienced to assure we can continue to maintain our market-leading positions and capture the opportunities that we believe our long-term European strategy presents for our company and our stockholders. Some of the changes relate to new productivity programs, while others involve changes in leadership. I will cover a few of our key initiatives in my closing remarks.\", \"As I mentioned in our May 2018 Investor Day, talent acquisition is a key initiative for our European segment, and in Q4, we made solid progress on this front. On December 20, the company announced that Arnd Franz will join LKQ Europe as Chief Operating Officer on April 1. Arnd is currently Corporate Executive Vice President and member of the management board of the MAHLE Group, where he has been responsible for the company's global automotive sales and application engineering, including their aftermarket business units.\", 'From 2006 to 2013, he was Executive Vice President and General Manager for MAHLE Aftermarket. Arnd will report directly to John Quinn, CEO of LKQ Europe. Arnd brings nearly 20 years of experience with Tier 1 automotive suppliers across Europe and has a strong record of successful integration efforts. He will be a great addition to the LKQ Europe leadership team.', \"Specific to Euro Car Parts, on January 2 of this year, the company announced that Andy Hamilton was appointed ECP's Chief Executive Officer. Andy joined ECP in 2010 where he held several executive roles, the last of which was Chief Operating Officer. During that period, ECP saw unprecedented growth as the network grew from 89 to over 220 branches. Prior to ECP, Andy held a variety of management roles for Halfords Group, the U.K.'s leading automotive and leisure retailer with over 500 locations.\", \"Additionally at ECP, we recently added two key people to the leadership team, including a Chief Administrative Officer and a Chief Supply Chain Officer. The Chief Administrative Officer and Varun actually worked together during their respective times at both CBRE and Johnson Controls. The primary task for this position is to focus on ECP's support and governance functions, with overall responsibility for legal, finance and human resources, thereby freeing Andy to focus on customer-facing and operating matters. The Chief Supply Chain Officer worked at ECP from 2014 to 2016 and we are excited to have him back on the team. The main responsibilities for this role are ECP's logistics and supply chain activities, including the leadership of the T2 facility.\", 'Finally, during Q4, we opened up a total of five new branches in Eastern Europe. Since acquiring Rhiag in 2016, we have opened 94 branches in Eastern Europe. And as we enter 2019, we are now focused on maximizing the productivity of our existing branches with just a handful of new openings planned for this year.', \"Now, let's move on to our specialty segment. During Q4, specialty reported total revenue growth of 8.9%, including organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5.8% and acquisition growth of more than 3%. Specialty continues to deliver strong results with EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 both achieving their highest levels since we entered this segment in 2014.\", 'During the 2018 SEMA Show, the specialty team launched a new mobile app that is capable of putting the power of their industry-best, eKeystone, business-to-business system into any device. This app harnesses mobile device technology, including voice-to-text capability, to allow users to search for products simply by saying a category or brand, and utilizes the mobile device camera to scan QR, UPC and vehicle VIN numbers and VIN barcodes.', \"The eKeystone app includes all the proprietary data in Keystone's B2B system, thereby providing subscribers access to approximately 800,000 catalogued SKUs, 400,000 images, 20,000 videos and 40,000 installation instructions and more. We are pleased with the early adoption rates of the app, which thus far have generated close to 4,000 downloads from our Keystone Automotive Operations' customers. This was a tremendous initiative and I credit our specialty team's effort to think outside the box and deliver solutions that enhance customer service and drive incremental sales.\", 'Moving on to corporate development, during the fourth quarter, we acquired three wholesale businesses in North America and two wholesale businesses in Europe for a total net consideration of approximately $14 million.', 'And finally, I would like to highlight that our board has approved management suggested changes to the structure of our compensation programs, whereby the incentives are directly aligned with our company-wide objectives. For our key leaders across the globe, the 2019 annual bonus program will incentivize EBITDA both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue, as well as improvements in free cash flow generation.', 'For the long-term cash incentive plan, the incentives will be based on return on invested capital, organic revenue growth and EPS growth over a three-year period. In addition, we are creating a new long-term performance share program tied to the achievement of the same target metrics.', 'And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2019 guidance.']}}, {'@id': '3', 'plist': {'p': ['Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter, cover our current liquidity position and provide 2019 guidance before turning it back to Nick for closing remarks.', 'The fourth quarter results featured several solid accomplishments and some further opportunities for us to realize. On the positive side, three key points to highlight. Number one, we continued to integrate STAHLGRUBER and I am happy to report that the business is performing in line with expectations and that we are achieving the synergies projected at this stage.', \"Two, our specialty segment, which historically has generated its lowest segment EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, saw an 80 basis point year-over-year improvement in this metric, largely due to effective margin management initiatives. And finally, three, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $190 million, which in total produced the highest annual operating cash flow in the company's history at $711 million and free cash flow $461 million. I am very proud of the team's dedication to working capital management, which I am confident will carry through into 2019 and beyond.\", 'On the other side of the ledger, as Nick described, we experienced some softness in revenue growth in the quarter in both North America and Europe. As previously noted, the North America segment was able to withstand the revenue softness relatively well, while in Europe, the softness in revenue growth created pressure on our segment EBITDA margin. I will provide further color on this when we discuss segment performance.', 'There is a larger spread between our GAAP and adjusted figures this quarter than we are typically accustomed to reporting. The variance is attributable to the underperformance of two specific investments, which resulted in an impairment charge in the fourth quarter totaling $75 million on an after-tax basis or about $0.23 per share.', 'Firstly, we recorded a $33 million goodwill impairment charge related to our aviation recycling business in North America that we acquired in early 2017. The changing market conditions have dampened our outlook for this business, prompting the charge, which was recognized as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment.', 'And second, in the equity earnings line, which is where we report our share of the results of Mekonomen, we recorded a loss of $46 million in the quarter. This loss is attributable to a $48 million non-cash impairment charge on our Mekonomen investment. We recorded a $23 million charge in the third quarter and unfortunately, the stock price declined further through December 31, necessitating another write-down.', \"Since the year-end, Mekonomen has announced its fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and revised its dividend policy that has resulted in yet another drop in its stock price. Unless there is a turnaround in the stock price in the coming weeks, we will need to record a further impairment charge in the first quarter. We're clearly disappointed in the performance of our investment in Mekonomen and are hopeful that the worst is behind us.\", \"Now, I'll turn to slide 13 and 14 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated results. The consolidated gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.7%, as positive improvements in both Europe and specialty segments more than offset a negative mix impact related to Europe. Specifically, the lower gross margin of Europe segment now makes up a larger percentage of the consolidated results, following the STAHLGRUBER acquisition. But, again, as I mentioned, we could more than offset this impact.\", 'Our operating expenses increased by 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily attributable to the negative leverage effect in Europe due to revenue softness that I mentioned earlier. Interest expense was up $10 million or 37% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher average debt balances primarily related to the STAHLGRUBER financing.', \"Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 28.3% for the quarter. The annual base tax rate was roughly 27.2%, which is consistent with our third quarter estimate. The higher rate for the fourth quarter reflects a roughly $1 million net negative impact from discrete items. We completed our analysis of the impact from U.S. tax reform and I'm happy to report that there were no adjustments to the provisional amounts in Q4.\", 'Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter were $0.13, down $0.28 relative to the comparable quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.48, reflecting a 17% improvement year-over-year.', 'Moving to the segments with North America on slide 17, gross margins during the fourth quarter were 43.5% or flat compared to the prior year. Our pricing initiatives in the aftermarket line have been successful in realizing gross margin benefits, though we experienced an offsetting decrease in our salvage operations, as car costs have moved higher with the mix shifting towards newer model year purchases. Similar to our aftermarket line, we are implementing pricing tools for our salvage products to enhance the gross margin generated on each car. Our self-service operations gross margins were roughly flat on a year-over-year basis with a non-recurring insurance recovery offsetting the negative impact of declining scrap steel prices.', \"Shifting to operating expenses, for North America, we saw an increase of 10 basis points, both compared to last year and sequentially. There were a few factors working in opposite directions this quarter. Facility expenses increased 50 basis points due to higher rent and utilities expenses and a non-recurring lease termination charge. Consistent with the first three quarters, we faced headwinds related to freight and vehicle expenses and these costs drove a 30 basis point increase over the prior year. We're actively working to address these headwinds as well as wage inflation and rising benefit costs through the margin initiatives noted previously and also through cost controls throughout the organization.\", 'Going the other direction, we had a non-recurring gain on an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 2018 that had a favorable 30 basis point impact. The remaining 40 basis points improvement primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense, reflecting our strong emphasis on receivable collections.', 'And finally, we saw a 40 basis point unfavorable movement in segment EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest line. While the operating results of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries impact the reported gross margin and operating expense figures, the allocation of the profit or loss from these businesses falls below operating profit. Last year, we allocated a loss from our non-wholly owned subsidiaries in North America to the minority shareholders, but reported income in these businesses in 2018, thereby creating the unfavorable year-over-year comparison.', 'In total, segment EBITDA for North America for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $153 million, roughly flat compared to the prior year.', \"Looking at slide 19, scrap prices were flat versus the comparable quarter a year ago, but down relative to the third quarter of 2018 by 3%. As we've previously mentioned, the impact from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time. Changes in scrap steel prices had a negative effect of approximately $5 million on segment EBITDA or a little over $0.01 on adjusted diluted EPS. The management team remains intensely focused on margin realization and the cost mitigation initiatives launched last year.\", 'Moving on to our European segment on slide 20, gross margin in Europe was 36.7% in the fourth quarter, a 100 basis point increase over the comparable period of 2017. Our Sator business in the Benelux region continued to show margin expansion, contributing a 30 basis point improvement to the segment, with specific strength in private label sales and the ongoing move from a three-step to a two-step model in that market. Our centralized procurement yielded a 40 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs.', 'With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 120 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago. The lower sales growth had a negative impact on operating leverage. STAHLGRUBER results, as I previously mentioned, were consistent with the previously disclosed projection for the year.', \"European segment's EBITDA totaled $107 million, a 38% increase over last year. As shown on slide 22, relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, both the pound sterling and the euro both weakened by 3% against the dollar, causing about a $0.01 negative effect from translation on adjusted EPS in the quarter.\", 'Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 7.5% for the fourth quarter of 2018, down 50 basis points from the same period last year, owing to revenue softness and lower-than-expected results, both in the United Kingdom and Italy.', 'The management team has implemented cost controls over all geographies, including reviews of discretionary spending and stringent additional approvals for head count. The European team has reiterated its commitment to the previously stated objective to deliver double-digit segment EBITDA margins by the end of the three-year period that started in January 2018.', 'Turning over to our specialty segment on slide 23, this business continues to deliver solid results. The gross margin percentage improved by 230 basis points in the fourth quarter relative to the comparable period of 2017. Of this amount, 120 basis points related to a non-recurring amortization impact in 2017 related to one purchase accounting, and additional 30 basis points increase is attributable to mix.', 'Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in specialty were flat relative to the prior year. Higher vehicle and fuel expenses and FX losses were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense, following on from the previously mentioned focus on collections. Segment EBITDA for specialty was $28 million, up 20% from the fourth quarter of 2017, and as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 70 basis points to 8.5%.', \"Let's move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. As presented on slide 25, you will note that our operating cash flows for 2018 was $711 million or up $192 million, a 37% increase versus 2017. Operating cash flows for the quarter was strong at $190 million, following the momentum in the third quarter owing to an emphasis on receivables collections and moderate inventory growth.\", 'CapEx for the quarter were $78 million and $250 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we made further pay downs on our credit facility borrowings, while repurchasing $60 million of LKQ stock under the repurchase program launched late last October. For the full year of 2018, we paid down $206 million on our credit facility borrowings. All of this was funded by strong operating cash flows.', 'Trade working capital as defined as receivables and inventory, offset by payables as a percentage of revenue, improved by 250 basis points, reflecting our commitments towards delivering strong cash flow. I am very heartened by the scale of improvement we could deliver, as this has come ahead of the structural change to the incentive compensation program in 2019 and more broad-based working capital efficiency programs.', 'Moving to slide 27, we amended and extended our credit facility in the fourth quarter. The changes increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility to $3.15 billion, offset by a lower term loan, extended the maturity through to January 2024, simplified the pricing tiers, and immediately reduced our borrowing margin by 25 basis points. As of the 31st of December, we had $332 million of unrestricted cash, resulting in net debt of about $4 billion or 2.9 times last 12 months EBITDA. Breaking through the less than 3 times benchmark is a crucial threshold as it further lowers the cost of our credit facility borrowings based on the revised pricing tiers as part of the credit facility amend and extend we executed in the fourth quarter.', \"On slide 28, we've added the key metrics that we track, though, please note that we are excluding the impact of STAHLGRUBER in the calculations to eliminate short-term movements caused by large investments. We will add STAHLGRUBER into the calculations once we've annualized the transaction.\", \"Now, I'd like to detail our annual guidance for 2019. Please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and FX rates hold at current levels and the annual tax rate is dialed in at 27%. Additionally, the guidance assumes no material disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union.\", 'We have set organic parts and services revenue growth at 2% to 4%. Given our fourth quarter revenue growth, the economic uncertainty in Europe and our continuing emphasis on profitable revenue growth, we are moderating our growth assumption for 2019. Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis is a range of $2.05 to $2.17, while adjusted diluted EPS is a range of $2.34 to $2.46. We are projecting solid business growth from our margin improvement efforts and an incremental $0.09 from a full year of STAHLGRUBER.', 'On the negative side, lower scrap prices and a stronger U.S. dollar reduced the year-over-year expectations by $0.07. Cash flows from operations reflect a range of $775 million to $850 million. We believe our focus on working capital management and increased profitability will drive higher cash flows in 2019.', 'Capital spending is set at a range of $250 million to $300 million, a modest increase from the current year level, though flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis when we normalize the expected increase owing to a full year of STAHLGRUBER CapEx and various European projects, most notably the ERP implementation. Taking the lower and the top ends of both OCF and CapEx, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $500 million in 2019.', 'In summary, we remain encouraged by the strength of our market-leading businesses, though acknowledge that we still have further work to do related to fully realizing the benefits of our initiatives to offset the ongoing cost pressures and to continue to improve profitability.', \"Now, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing remarks.\"]}}, {'@id': '2', 'plist': {'p': [\"Thank you, Varun, for that financial overview. I believe that we are taking the necessary steps to position the company for continued long-term success. Looking back on 2018, we crossed some major milestones that our team of over 50,000 employees across the globe should be proud of, including achieving the highest annual top line revenue in the company's history up 22% over 2017; generating the highest annual cash flow figures in the company's history, with operating cash flow and free cash flow up 37% and 36%, respectively, over 2017 levels; closing the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, the largest acquisition in the company's history; completing the largest capital raise in the company's history through notes with 8 and 10-year maturities at attractively low fixed interest rates, and amending our credit facility to provide more flexibility and better pricing.\", 'With that, let me summarize a few of the key initiatives for 2019. First, we have built strong businesses with leading companies in our core geographies. Our focus will now shift towards operational excellence through the integration and simplification of our operating model. The management team will concentrate on leveraging the strengths of the business units for profitable revenue growth, margin improvement and cash conversion.', \"Second, all of our businesses will be closely monitoring costs to drive out duplicative expenses, tighten controls over discretionary spending and react quicker to changing market conditions. Third, we will invest in our future through long-term projects like the ERP implementation in Europe, a centralized European catalog system and the multi-year development of a new NDC in the Netherlands. While these projects often don't produce an immediate benefit, they are essential for positioning the business for future growth and profitability.\", 'Finally, the revamped compensation programs will help ensure the management incentives are in even tighter alignment with the key priorities of the company and the expectations of our stockholders.', 'In closing, I am proud of how our team of over 50,000 employees performed during 2018 in the midst of various operating challenges in both North America and Europe. Our team never took their eye off the ball and continue to work tirelessly to create and evolve what we all believe is a unique company.', 'Our extensive distribution networks, the breadth and depth of our inventory and our industry-leading fulfillment rates position us well to deliver consistent profitable growth and drive higher levels of operating efficiencies across all segments. This focus on our operational excellence should translate into continued long-term value for our shareholders.', 'And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.']}}]}, {'@name': 'Q&A', 'speaker': [{'@id': '0', 'plist': {'p': {'mark': {'@type': 'Operator Instructions'}, '#text': 'And your first question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens.

So, I'm just kind of wanting to hear the puts and takes for your expectations for margin improvement in Europe in 2019, if you don't see kind of that continued operating deleverage we saw in the fourth quarter. So, just kind of wanting to hear the offsets there would be great. Thanks.\"}}, {'@id': '3', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"Yeah. Absolutely, Stephanie. Good morning. It's Varun Laroyia. Great question. I think if you kind of look back into 2018 with regards to our European segment, going back to Q1, you'll recall we had some challenges in the UK operations with our Tamworth facility. Coming out of that, obviously, there was a capitalized cost to recover that central distribution center. And then, thereon, there was also some price discounting that was taking place. So, that was kind of one piece that we don't really expect to continue into the future as we think about 2019.\", 'The other piece is, as you think about the broader European landscape, Italy, we know has been soft and clearly, there was a deleverage that ended up taking place out there. And then, obviously, some other elements, we get the full year benefit of some of the distribution centers that we had shut down in anticipation of Tamworth coming through, and the same thing with Andrew Page also.', 'So, as we think of some of those kind of puts and takes, clearly, there are certain elements that impacted our 2018 operational results in the European landscape. And as we think about 2019, we do believe that those elements would have stabilized.

As we go through the planning process each year and a very detailed budgeting process, clearly, the expectations for every one of our businesses around the globe is not only to generate good organic growth, but also to improve their margins. And that is true in Europe. It's true actually in the North American and specialty businesses as well. And I think you will find the underpinning really of the consensus that Varun walked through is an assumption and some pretty detailed plans by our operating businesses to improve margins across the board with one exception and that's the self-serve business here in the United States, which has to deal with scrap prices. And there's only so much they can do to offset the negative impact from scrap as it relates to their operating margins.

I think if I take your question, Bret, in terms of what's driving – well, what drove free cash flow higher in 2018 and as to what gives us the confidence going into 2019 for the free cash flow guidance – three key pieces really to think through. One, 2018 to 2019, there clearly is a higher profitability from the focus on pursuing profitable revenue, the margin realization initiatives that we launched last year and also the cost containment programs that are currently in place. So, that's kind of the starting point for free cash flow.\", \"The second point is just active working capital management. And if you think about the momentum that we saw in the third quarter, which we continued into the fourth quarter, really, the focus has been on some very simple elements in the balance sheet. Within our cash flow statement, you can actually see this come through, the focus with collections. In 2017, it was a $56 million outflow. And in 2018, it was basically flat. So, we didn't invest – despite the fact the business grew significantly, we didn't really invest that much more in receivables because we were actually going and collecting the cash that was due to us.\", \"The second point is if you look at inventory, inventory did grow also on a year-over-year basis with the larger scale of business, but it was about $77 million lower than what it was in 2017, right. And then the final piece, quite frankly, is the opportunity that's still out there for us to go get. The single biggest piece, which kind of held us back I'd say, is on a year-over-year basis, there was a $122 million swing on accounts payable. It was a significant outflow, right. And so, as you think about each of these key elements and as to what we continue to focus on, simplistically put, there is further opportunity in any case.\", \"I think the final piece, which actually is a wrapper across the entire working capital and free cash flow piece, is the incentive compensation plans, and these obviously have been aligned with the goals in 2019.

With regards to cost containment efforts and also OpEx, there's a few things to kind of think through. Firstly, here in North America, a bunch of our wage inflation or the freight elements essentially get annualized. And again, what we have seen, I think the last four to five months, has been a – not a de-acceleration or a downward trend – but basically being a flattening out of some of those expenses that are kind of coming through. So, that's point number one. And clearly, from the second half of the fourth quarter, we saw fuel come down also some; not enough to offset the various elements, given the fact that wage pressures have kind of flown into the freight cost also.\", 'And as you think about going into 2019, the cost containment efforts, specifically with head count adds, were essentially trying to make the business more resilient with the revised projections from a growth perspective, which I believe are actually very pragmatic. And quite frankly, the cost structure will follow this level of pragmatism rather than building up a cost infrastructure which was geared for a far higher growth level as such, right.', 'And then, finally, if you think about it, as Nick mentioned in his opening comments also, the overall expectation for each of our businesses is to secure positive operating leverage. And again, with the change in the incentive compensation plans, there is margin growth, both in absolute dollars, but also on a margin percentage that we expect. So, again, there are only so much that one can do in terms of being able to realize certain margin benefits, but clearly the cost containment and the OpEx productivity is a key lever in being able to deliver higher year-over-year margins.']}}, {'@id': '0', 'plist': {'p': 'Your next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird.

It's not a nice flat set of growth. In Q1 and in Q2 2018, had monster comps that we're working against. If you recall that the organic growth in North America in Q1 and Q2 of 2018 was in around the 7% range. So, that is creating a pretty big hurdle.\", \"If you will, there are a couple things that we anticipate in Q1 that will kind of run against organic growth. First, we annualized the battery contract with FCA, just to refresh everyone's memory, that added about 1% to our organic growth as to what we reported in 2018. So that positive increment will come off the boards, if you will. It has also become apparent that as FCA was ramping their activities with us that there were some kind of one-time benefits, if you will, that we got in getting the program up and running and that will not return in 2019. We're really at a steady state now with the FCA battery shipments. And so we're anticipating batteries will actually be down year-over-year in the first quarter.\", \"Also, AeroVision, clearly, not meeting our expectations. That's the business where we took the impairment charge here in Q4. Our expectation is the business is underperforming and it will also be down in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis.\", \"From a margin perspective, again, we're anticipating upticks in margins in each of our businesses, with North America being muted a little bit by the significant downdraft on the scrap prices, which is noted in the deck, hit us for the better part of $0.04 a share or so for the year.

And can you remind us on how you guys think about the longer-term opportunity from increasing your factoring in that market with respect to parts and services?'}}, {'@id': '3', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"Yeah. So, Daniel, I think you're kind of referring to the unwind of the factoring program that we had through one of our STAHLGRUBER subsidiaries. So it wasn't the case of starting up our factoring program. It was actually an unwind of our factoring program, which would result in the receivables coming back to us. So that's what it was.\", \"We don't really have an active factoring program. We don't want to go down that path. Really, where the opportunity is, as we've talked about, from a European perspective, a number of the same supplier community does provide product into the North American folks out here. So, again, they are well-tuned in terms of what the expectations are. And we do have a tremendous opportunity from a European perspective to be able to unlock that piece.\", \"Whether it be through a vendor financing program or through an extension of payables, the end goal is the same, to be able to have our payables essentially match the days inventory on hand to a point, right. And that's how the conversion would work. And then, obviously, active management on our DSO with regards to receivables.\", \"So, you are right about the fact that there is an opportunity for our European business. And again, it has been contemplated in the plans we've put together with that business and it also reflects the targets that they are being tasked with for 2019. But again, just to confirm, there was no startup of a factoring program. It was actually an unwind of a factoring program for one of the STAHLGRUBER subsidiaries in the fourth quarter.\"]}}, {'@id': '0', 'plist': {'p': 'Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe.

Just a question on North America, so I know you guys are getting a lot tougher on discounting and trying to contain pricing. Wanted to see how you're thinking about the Caliber-ABRA merger.

Thank you.\"}}, {'@id': '2', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': [\"Great question. Obviously, both Caliber and ABRA are excellent organizations. They've been incredibly good customers of ours for years and years. No surprise that there are a couple of our largest customers just due to the total number of shops that they operate. On a combined basis, they're going to be at about 1,050 shops across the country, if you will, and they've got posted plans to grow that to north of 1,500 shops, I think, over the next three years or so.\", \"We've got a great relationship with both organizations and we look forward to being a great partner with them as they continue to move forward in their business plans. Again, we believe that we provide an excellent level of service to these organizations. That's why they are a big customers of ours. We can get them the parts they need when they need them. There's no doubt about it. They already get our largest discounts, if you will, because they're already amongst our top three or four customers. So, we don't anticipate any major changes there.\", \"To the extent that they have market overlap, because you got to remember, this is very much a local business, and what happens to go on, say, in Dallas, doesn't have anything to do what goes on, say, up in Boston or in Portland, Oregon, right. It's a local business. And to the extent in any given local market they have overlap, where we can find ways to be more efficient in servicing the combined organization, we're absolutely going to have discussions with them to see how we can make their business better and our business better. So, again, we have tremendous relationships at the very senior levels of both organizations.

The heavy duty market in South America is expected to be between 105,000 and 115,000 units.', \"The slide highlights current trends in the trucking industry in North America and Europe. In North America, fleet consolidation will continue with carriers focused on improving utilization and overall efficiency. Fleets will adopt ADAS technologies and automated transmissions to enhance safety and efficiency as well as to reduce the dependence on driver's skill.\", 'Over the next five years, truck OEMs and customers will increase their involvement in field testing of alternative powertrains including electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell powered trucks to determine which of these technologies provide the greatest return for our customers. Connected services will become more functional in supporting efficient customer operations and be an increasing source of revenue. Phase 2 Greenhouse Gas legislation will result in the introduction of new vehicles and engine technologies that will meet regulatory requirements and will provide better fuel efficiency for our customers.', 'In Europe, many trends are similar to North America. The increasing size and sophistication of fleets will support the adoption of ADAS technologies and customers will begin to evaluate and adopt alternative powertrains. In each city regulations regarding zero emissions, visibility and noise reduction will also contribute to product changes. Regulations to allow for an increase in vehicle length will enable improved aerodynamics and fuel efficiency.', 'In South America, long-term economic growth will enable truck market expansion. The region will see the continued transition to modern Euro 5 and 6 standards and high-quality, low-operating cost cab over engine trucks will lead the market.', \"In India, the government has announced the transition to Euro 6 emissions technologies in 2020. This could increase demand for higher quality components and expectations related to overall product quality. Gradual improvement in India's road infrastructure will support economic growth and the development of the truck industry. With an installed capacity of 2 million units per year, Chinese OEMs have excess production capacity. This excess will exist for the foreseeable future as the OEMs have little incentive to right size.\", 'China has announced that it will transition to Euro 6 beginning with large cities in 2020, and the rest of the country to follow. The maturing of the transportation system will drive an increased demand for higher horsepower trucks and technologies like automated transmissions and anti-lock brakes.', 'PACCAR is making significant investments to provide our customers the best trucks, technology and services.

I'd now like to introduce Kyle Quinn, PACCAR's Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Kyle?\"]}}, {'@id': '3', 'plist': {'p': [\"Thanks, Preston. Good morning. I'm Kyle Quinn, PACCAR Chief Technology Officer. I've been with PACCAR for 14 years, including several years as Chief Information Officer and most recently General Manager of Peterbilt Motors. Prior to joining PACCAR, I spent 20 years with Boeing in engineering and technology leadership roles. Today, I'll share some information about our progress and plans for the development of advanced powertrain, autonomy and connectivity.\", \"Looking to the year 2030, the transportation industry should experience significant change. The line haul segment will advance toward highly aerodynamic vehicles with high efficiency. Line haul will likely continue to be dominated by diesel engines well past 2030 based on cost, weight and range requirements. Hydrogen fuel cell could be a feasible option to achieve zero emissions for a portion of line haul trucks. It's likely that Level 4 autonomy will be in use for on-highway driving. At Level 4, a driver remains in the vehicle but human intervention is not required within the limits of the system. Regional haul segment will continue to utilize day cabs but both diesel, hybrid and battery electric will continue to grow as zero emission city requirements are implemented.\", 'Electric powertrains are expected to grow more quickly in this segment than in line haul. Again, autonomy will be utilized to improve safety and reduce driver burden while on highway. The urban delivery option will continuously move towards smaller vehicles. This includes step vans, delivery vans and possibly automated and man pods. Diesel and gasoline will see a reducing role in this segment and zero emission options will be on the rise. As autonomy matures, adoption will also grow in urban areas.', 'Sustainability has grown to be a significant driver in the development of future technologies in our industry. The priorities include the need for worldwide reductions in carbon dioxide and the improvement of air quality at the local level, particularly in urban areas.', 'New regulations for Europe and North America are coming that will further limit carbon dioxide emissions. The EU regulation shown at the top of this slide in blue will be introduced in two steps for 15% reduced output in 2025, and a total of 30% reduction in 2030. The EU will also mandate 2% of an OEM production to be zero emission in 2025.', \"On the lower part of the slide, U.S. regulation of Greenhouse Gas Phase 2 are in three steps. Beginning with 14% vehicle reduction in 2021, growing to 20% in 2024 and 25% in 2027. In 2023, California plans to begin requiring that 2.5% of an OEM sales into the state are zero emission vehicles with a higher percentage over time. We'll utilize a combination of diesel, hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell powertrains to meet these increasing emission regulations. While these regulations will require new technologies, the reduced CO2 emissions equate to improvements in fuel economy for our customers.\", 'In order to maximize the efficiency of diesel powertrains, our teams around the world are working with the U.S. Department of Energy on SuperTruck II. This work is focused on doubling the efficiency of freight transport. Many of the technologies used in the program will be implemented into our production vehicles in the near term.', 'This is a summary of the four concepts of vehicle electrification. At the top of the chart, mild and strong hybrid concepts are distinguished by the amount of power available from the hybrid. Mild hybrids, a mild hybrid is low power and is used to boost fuel economy and electrify accessories that are currently belt driven. Strong hybrid is high power and enables the diesel engine to be downsized. It can also propel the truck in zero emission mode for a short range. Strong hybrids require a larger battery than mild hybrids.', 'In the lower right, battery electric vehicles use a motor generator that is the only source of propulsion and power supplied by a battery. A large battery is used to achieve the necessary range. Fuel cell vehicles are similar to battery electric, but they add a fuel cell to extend the range of the truck by recharging the battery. Our approach to these concepts is to develop common modular components that can plug and play across most applications.', 'Today, high-efficiency clean diesel trucks are the dominant product used to haul freight in our markets. With the next introduction of U.S. Greenhouse Gas regulations in 2024 and CO2 reductions in Europe in 2025, a hybrid solution will be likely an effective technology to reduce fuel usage and CO2 output in some vehicle applications.', 'As the weight and cost of fuel cell and battery electric powertrains are reduced, these solutions could become preferred methods to achieve zero emissions in the future. Fuel cells could enable a heavy-duty truck to have an effective range for line haul and battery electric vehicles could meet the needs of regional haul and medium-duty customers.', \"An important element in the deployment of electric vehicles is charging and the infrastructure necessary to support the vehicle energy needs. Most fleets will need one charger per truck at their hubs as well as opportunities to top up the battery during operation. In locations where infrastructure is lacking, charging may be supported by a micro grid that will provide the electric power cost effectively. A micro grid can collect power from a variety of sources and store energy until it's needed.\", \"In 2018, PACCAR built test units in each of these configurations. These vehicles are currently operating and we're monitoring it and collecting performance data. In Europe, DAF has developed a CF Parallel hybrid truck with a 20-mile electric-only range as well as a CF Electric truck with a 75-mile range. Customers operating these two trucks are requesting additional deliveries. In North America, Kenworth has built a hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicle designed to support port operations that has a range of 300 miles. Peterbilt has developed several electric truck designs.\", \"On the lower left is the Refuse application with an 80-mile range. In the lower center is an electric 579 for port operations with a 150-mile range. In the lower right is a medium duty truck with a 150-mile range. This year, we're placing initial trucks in customer operations and expect volumes to increase over time dependent on grants and subsidies.\", \"As our development of electric powertrain has progressed, we have learned that considerable level of common components can be used across the four vehicle concepts. As a result, we're sharing significant components across our electric truck designs. By doing this, we gain both volume and cost benefits. These include motors, batteries and controls, electrified accessories and charging systems. We'll achieve a set of common scalable systems in our advanced powertrains.\", 'Another emerging technology is Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, commonly referred to as ADAS and autonomy. Our competitors, suppliers, new start-up companies and PACCAR are pursuing autonomous driving systems. Some of the developing technologies that are needed for ADAS and autonomy include cameras, LiDAR and radar.', \"Shown here are the two ADAS levels that are being developed in the industry. Level 2 means that the vehicle has the ability to accelerate, brake and steer. But a Level 2 system is considered a safety system and does not remove the driver's responsibility to maintain control of the vehicle. The sensors and systems required to operate a Level 2 vehicle are cameras, radar, sensor fusion, which have the ability to combine the perceived information into real-time digital path planning as well as the operation of the throttle, brakes and steering.\", 'Level 4 shown on the bottom is an autonomous vehicle that can operate without any involvement of the driver in certain predetermined cases like point-to-point operation.

PACCAR has an A+ credit rating, allowing our finance company to borrow funds at competitive rates. The regular quarterly dividend has increased an annual average of 11% over the last 20 years. PACCAR has declared $6 billion in dividends over the last decade. The company has paid a dividend every year since 1941.', \"PACCAR's consistent profitability reflects its industry-leading product quality, financial discipline, and continuous innovation. Revenue and net income 10-year trends are shown in the top two graphs, and performance over the last five quarters is shown in the bottom graph. Over the past 10 years PACCAR achieved record revenues due to growth in truck markets, increased Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF market share and growing parts and financial services business.\", 'Quarterly revenues shown on the bottom left have increased steadily to a record $6.49 billion in the first quarter of 2019. A 15% improvement over the first quarter of 2018. PACCAR earned a record $2.2 billion in net income in 2018, as shown in the upper right. First quarter net income of $629 million was up 23% from the first quarter 2018, reflecting strong truck markets in the U.S. and Canada and Europe, resulting in a record truck deliveries, record parts profit and excellent financial services results.', 'This chart summarize PACCAR truck and parts gross profit and margins. Gross profit are the green bars and gross margin percentages are the red lines. Truck segment gross profit and gross margins increased over the last decade, as shown in the upper left graph. The higher margins in 2015 were helped by strong truck market material cost tailwinds due to reduced commodity prices. These material cost tailwinds partially reversed over the following three years.', \"The lower left graph shows that truck segment gross margin grew to 12.5% in the first quarter this year. Major contributors were 3% higher price realization, partially offset by higher material costs compared to 2018. Parts' gross profit shown in the upper right has steadily grown to a record $1 billion in 2018. PACCAR parts achieved strong gross margins of 27.7% in the first quarter of 2019, driven by operational leverage from increased volume and favorable pricing.\", 'Total truck and parts gross margin and operating margin trends show excellent results and reflect a premium price of our products, industry-leading operating efficiency, and increased deliveries resulting from higher market shares. PACCAR achieved strong gross margins of 15% and operating margins of 11.5% in the first quarter. Gross margins are expected to be in the 14.5% to 15% range for the second quarter and the full-year 2019, with truck sales projected to grow faster than parts during the rest of this year.', \"Due to PACCAR's high profitability, strong working capital management, and prudent investments, PACCAR leads its peer group in return on invested capital. PACCAR's return on invested capital was 25.7% in 2018 and averaged 21.8% over the last five years. Our peer group ranged from 7% to 16%. PACCAR's operating margin shown in green has been at the top of the industry for the last seven years, reflecting the premium value of our products and our leadership in operating efficiency. PACCAR achieved an operating margin of 11.5% in the first quarter of 2019. This is a testament to the outstanding performance of our 28,000 employees.\", \"PACCAR achieved much higher inventory turns compared to the competition. This illustrates PACCAR's commitment to lean manufacturing and the benefits of the PACCAR production system. When comparing receivable days of sales outstanding to our competitors, it's clear that with an average of only 22 days, PACCAR manages its working capital very effectively. PACCAR maintains a clear and consistent capital allocation strategy that has resulted in an industry-leading return on invested capital. PACCAR pays quarterly and annual dividends.\", \"Total dividends declared increased 41% in 2018 compared to the previous year. PACCAR typically distributes about 50% of its earnings to shareholders each year. As the chart on the right shows, of the $7.4 billion earned in the last five years, the company distributed dividends of $3.5 billion to shareholders. While we favor returning capital through dividends, PACCAR also repurchases PACCAR's shares opportunistically when our shares are attractively priced. At the end of the first quarter this year, $507 million was remaining from the $800 million authorized by the board last year.\", \"Looking again at the chart, the company repurchased for 700 million of its shares in the last five years. PACCAR continuously looks for opportunities to accelerate our strategy with acquisitions. We're highly selective and have a long history of making successful strategic acquisitions that demonstrate a clear path to value creation. All three of PACCAR's truck divisions were acquisitions.

The backlog noted by the green bars reached a record level in October 2018 following several months of high orders. Industry production shown by the red line has increased over the last year in response to the strong customer demand. The extraordinary backlog of 231,000 trucks at the end of April should carry the industry well through 2019. Kenworth and Peterbilt, represent more than 35% of the industry backlog.', 'We review our backlog in detail every month and discuss it with our dealers and customers. Cancellations have not been material as customer demand remains solid. Customers have continued to place a modest level of orders during the last few months. If this continues for the remainder of this year, we will start 2020 with a very healthy backlog. With this in mind, we plan to build as many trucks as we can this year.', 'As mentioned, the economic, freight and backlog situation is positive for the U.S. truck market. The U.S. and Canada market is expected to increase to a range of 295,000 to 315,000 Class 8 trucks this year. We also expect another strong European heavy truck market this year ranging from 290,000 to 320,000 heavy trucks. At the midpoint, this would be the fourth year for the European truck market to exceed 300,000 trucks. And in South America, the above-16-tonne truck market is projected to grow to a range of 105,000 to 115,000 trucks this year as the Brazilian and other South American economies continue to grow.', \"As future industry regulations will improve truck fuel efficiency, we expect truck market volatility from emissions-related pre-buys to be significantly less than what we've seen in the last 15 years.

Just a big-picture question from the financials you've put up over the last 20 years. If you went back 20 years ago and said your revenues were going to triple and a third of those truck deliveries were coming from market share gains, obviously impressive. The COGS grew generally in line with the revs, but your R&D and SG&A only grew 19% while the revenues tripled.

We're not so as affected by the cycles up and down. We can make the plan. We can commit to it. And that's been the way we've operated over that period.

So we're seeing it steadily increase, I think with that pace of increase in R&D and probably as well as capital. Capital is a lot more driven by factory capacity and new product renewal.

Is that now going to be measured in a matter of hours as opposed to a day, how much more finely can you get that to support uptime?\"}}, {'@id': '1', '@type': 'a', 'plist': {'p': \"I'm to give you my thought, and then I'm going to ask David to add in.

We bought land in Louisville to build another distribution center, large distribution center in Louisville. We've got some visions of what we're going to be doing in Europe with additional locations there. And so, I think, we will continue to invest. Typically, when we build one, we build it for 15 years' worth of capacity. And I think with some of the growth we've seen, we've probably gotten there may be a little faster than what we thought we might. So, that would just be a continuing investment to be able to meet those needs.

When you think about all the things we're doing around the world with new trucks, we've got to be proactive in supporting that truck. When the first truck gets built, dealers have to have parts. It's not a reactionary thing anymore. So customer uptime is parts is at the dealer when a brand new trucks shows up for brand new model. And then you couple that with TRP products and advancements around the world, new product in different markets that also adds to the distribution network capacity equation, and we're very proud of what we're doing with the dealers, the supply chain with the supplier and the dealer and us really put is a huge advantage for us over everybody else.\", \"So I love your question about days versus hours, versus minutes, and that's really what's service management is about. What are the metrics for us to be able to get a truck in, diagnose, repaired and back and on the road and parts availability is a big piece of that, and that is definitely a minutes or hours calculation, not days.

And you're not going to see dramatic adoption like Kyle showed it well, that you're going to see an uptick in electrification and hybrid power fuel-cells and whatever other kind of technologies come to bear on the market. And I don't think that in the medium term that's going to affect the parts distribution or parts consumption, there's still a powertrain to it. There's a set of batteries that come with it.

So, a way for us to think about that is getting the DAF trucks homologated to be sellable into China and have that product available when it gets to Euro 6. We have a great product and participate, figure out the distribution et cetera for the vehicle. But that's a way to get in and get started. As we've all traveled to China, the Chinese truck market is heavily subsidized and it's you really couldn't effectively compete without a Chinese partner and at this point that's been difficult. But as time goes on, we'll see what we can do with our existing trucks selling into the market at a probably a relatively lower pace.

We believe the strong domestic consumption needs are supportive of a healthy growth prospect and that the Chinese express delivery industrial will continue to maintain steady growth momentum.\", \"Through our arduous journey in the past 17 years, ZTO surpassed from behind and if we were to outperform our peers and the 10 superior advantage and involve ultimately to work eco advantage. We have a long road ahead. We must be thankful for the great area we are in, stay on course to what we want to accomplish, treasure our partners and to carry out each task earnestly.\", \"With that, I thank you for your attention. Next, let us hear from Ms. Yan, who will discuss the financials.\"]}}, {\"@id\": \"3\", \"plist\": {\"p\": [\"Thank you, Chairman Lai, and hello to everyone on the call. As I go through our financial results, please note that unless specifically noted, all numbers quoted are in RMB and percentage changes refer to year-over-year comparisons. Detailed analysis of our financial performance, unit economics and cash flow summaries are posted on our website here and I will only highlight some of the key points. ZTO delivered a strong volume growth this quarter and exceeded our earnings expectations without compromising quality of services. Our volume grow nearly 1 billion parcels, the speed that is 18.4 percentage points faster than the industry average. Consequently, our market share rose 2.3 points to 18.9% for the quarter.\", \"Total revenues for our core express delivery business were approximately RMB 5 billion which grew 26.6% as a result of mixed effect of 45.9% volume increase and 13.2% price decrease due to incentives given as necessary competitive measures during the quarter. Revenues for key accounts were approximately RMB 619 million; an increase of 31.7% on a 50% volume growth. Key accounts represent less than 10% of our total volume. Total cost of goods sold increased 26.1%. Volume correlated sorting and transportation costs grew 27.8% and 31.7% respectively as a result of scale leverage and very effective cost control. The net effect is that gross margin rate decreased 1 percentage point from last year to 30.3%. Income from operations grew 28.3% and SG&A excluding SBC as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.3% compared to 5.6% last year. We continue to demonstrate sound corporate cost advantage. Higher amount for tax rebate and government subsidies this quarter helped the 0.8 point up margin rate increase. Adjusted net income grew 24.6% to reach RMB 1.32 billion and adjusted net income rate was 24.6% compared to 25% last year; relatively stable.\", \"Last, turning to unit economics per parcel. This key decline was RMB 0.25 out of which RMB 0.23 was associated with volume incentives. Competition remained relatively intense particularly in sales region buildings during the third quarter. Cost of goods sold went down by RMB 0.14 per parcel, of which RMB 0.11 came from line haul transportation and sorting hub cost savings. The increased use of self-owned vehicles with increasing proportion of higher capacity trailer trucks helped drive down unit transportation cost by RMB 0.06, the increase in the number of automated sorting equipment helped to keep head count low and sorting hub cost per parcel also went down and by RMB 0.05.\", \"With better SG&A leverage adding back another RMB 0.02 adjusted operating income per parcel declined by RMB 0.06. Operating cash flow was RMB 1.42 billion and CapEx spending was RMB 1.71 billion which brings year-to-date total CapEx spending to RMB 3.44 billion. Our annual CapEx commitment remains to be RMB 6.8 billion as we expect cash outlay to be around RMB 4 billion to RMB 5 billion for the year. In summary, we delivered a strong third quarter on both market share gains and earnings expansion. Our strategy is sound and our resource advantage and execution capabilities continue to support accelerated volume increase and operational stability for thousands of our network partners.\", \"We left our annual guidance unchanged at this time. Our track record has well-demonstrated our ability to consistently achieve our set goals. Given the most recent market condition plus October performance to-date, we are very confident that we are well on our way to deliver on our set target. This concludes our prepared remarks.\", \"Operator, please open the line for questions.

This is a large increase. We also installed 79 sets of large sorting equipment in around 42 sorting hubs and we added also a couple hundred dynamic weighing machines to better process and replace some of the manual works that was done before. Parcels sorted through our automation equipment accelerated to about 66% of total parcel and automated sorting equipment line, it will be partially used to offset increase in the labor cost as you understand labor cost is about 70% of our sorting hub cost which indicates that we still have plenty of room to improve and the fact that in the fourth quarter so far what we've seen especially during Double 11 period, our cost performance is much better than last year as well.

ASPs had fallen as a result, but also the unit costs have been quite successful and unit cost cuts and result the EBITDA per parcel has fallen, but you've still delivered a very strong profit growth. So into the 2020 how are we seeing now unit cost cuts. How much room do we have and how that really impacts your pricing strategy and leading to the outlook for profits for parcels?\", \"And second question is on just the franchisee.

For the first question, outlook for 2020 is very positive. We believe the express delivery industry in China will continue to grow steadily and it's very likely another RMB 10 billion parcel growth for 2020 that is very possible. And this is based on the track record and also an analysis of the domestic consumption needs which is still very strong. For our cost effectiveness  (00:27:16) we still believe there're plenty of room; especially next year we are looking to install more large sorting equipment also with each position and also technology involvement. Some of our operational excellence will continue to evolve and with volume increase and the scaled leverage, we have better opportunity to realize cost efficiency going forward.\"}, \"On the second part with the impact potentially on our network partners; two points we want to make that with of course first of all the volume growth as a backdrop of our overall industry because of the volume advantage, ZTO is able to provide more volume to our network partners which hence helped them in decreasing the cost on pickup and the delivery end roughly we estimated about RMB 0.10 advantage in that area. And then secondly, our brand brings about recognition about our stable services and quality of services.

We typically increase our price each year. And looking at the fourth quarter, we are experiencing lesser price incentives, if you will, for the fourth quarter.\", \"And the second question, on the last-mile, chairman indicated there are two aspects for us to pay attention to. The first is the physical location or the post operations or last-mile outlets. We have coordinated our effort with Cainiao and so far for the year there're about 5,000 new hosts added under the Cainiao Post brand. In addition, ZTO's also expanded its own footprint on last-mile post operations.
